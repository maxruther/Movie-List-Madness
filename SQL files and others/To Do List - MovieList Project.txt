Movie List Project
------------------


Python:

- The SQL procedures can be defined in SQL scripts, but the Python script should handle the running of things.

- The Python ingestion script needs to run the getWatched() procedure. (Should be quick.)

- Request Developer token from Evernote


SQL:





DONE

- Create a procedure that generates allUnwatched
- Consider aggregating unwatched movies from non-backburning tables into an allUnwatched
	- Have the aggregating procedure assign 'priority rank' based on the 'og' source table.

- Make it so that the "og" movie tables are automatically generated with the proper constraints:
	- Constrain "Watched" and "Watched in theater" domain to values 1 and 0 only.
	- Make Primary Key out of Title + Director

- Add a "native index" attribute during ingestion, so that the original ordering of the tables can be recreated in SQL.

- Create a stored procedure, "getWatched()", that creates an " allWatched table that lists all watched movies. It must always expect duplicates amongst the tables, as such duplicate entry is the current method of attributing genre.
	- It was a little tricky adjusting to the MySQL syntax for defining procedures, particularly for loops using cursors. I was also slow to see the critical importance of changing the Delimiter setting away from ';'.
	- It was VERY tricky getting the prepared statement to work, so that I could query tables that are only provided at runtime.
