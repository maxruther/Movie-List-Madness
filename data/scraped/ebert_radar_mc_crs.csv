Secret Mall Apartment,2025,RogerEbert.com,88,Matt Zoller Seitz,"This is a delightful, thought-provoking movie that’s about a lot of things at the same time. It’ll make you see the world with fresh eyes, and probably wonder why there isn’t more art in it.","Mar 21, 2025"

Secret Mall Apartment,2025,New York Magazine (Vulture),70,Bilge Ebiri,"These are the intriguing ideas at work in Secret Mall Apartment, but the film works as a movie thanks to the sly way it’s been put together.","Mar 21, 2025"
Misericordia,2025,The Playlist,100,Ankit Jhunjhunwala,"This is rigorous filmmaking of the highest order, controlled and precise to the exclusion of anything extraneous —evidenced by its taut 100-minute runtime.","May 27, 2024"
Misericordia,2025,The Film Stage,91,Leonardo Goi,"For all its morbid undertones and philosophical ruminations, Misericordia is neither a dirge nor a lofty symposium. Strange as it may be to say for a story that begins with a burial and then shatters after a heinous death, this is a supremely and surprisingly funny film, where humor gradually accrues a subversiveness not unlike desire’s own.","May 27, 2024"

Misericordia,2025,The Daily Beast,88,Nick Schager,"A superb thriller that employs common genre devices for a canny and caustic rumination on right and wrong, love and lust, virtue and vice.","Mar 18, 2025"
Misericordia,2025,RogerEbert.com,88,Simon Abrams,"It’s not a hard movie to follow or fall for, as fans of Guiraudie’s earlier movies already know. He commands our attention even when his characters are either too ridiculous or too petty to be taken seriously.","Mar 21, 2025"
Misericordia,2025,Screen Daily,80,Jonathan Romney,"This might suggest that Misericordia is ultimately a film with a message, and a more solemn one than we’re used to with Guiraudie. But any apparent clarity should be taken with a pinch of salt, the film’s meanings shifting as constantly as the erotic drives between the various male (and occasionally female) characters.","May 27, 2024"

Misericordia,2025,Los Angeles Times,80,Joshua Rothkopf,"This isn’t the kind of puzzle thriller in which all the elements click into place with a thudding literalism that compliments an attentive eye. It’s one that accommodates the vagaries of human behavior, leaving punishment aside as a secondary concern.","Mar 21, 2025"
Misericordia,2025,Slant Magazine,75,Brad Hanford,"Misericordia finds Alain Guiraudie revisiting old standbys under a relatively conventional set of aesthetic strategies. Fortunately, the ideas roiling under the former wildman’s newly placid surfaces are as potent as ever.","Sep 10, 2024"
Misericordia,2025,The A.V. Club,75,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,"While it lacks the surrealistic and fairy-tale elements that distinguish many of Guiraudie’s films (among them Sunshine For The Poor, Time Has Come, and Staying Vertical), Misericordia is nonetheless pervaded by a casual dreaminess and a disregard for the strictures of realism that leads in some (intentionally) silly directions.","Mar 20, 2025"
Misericordia,2025,The Hollywood Reporter,70,Jordan Mintzer,"The two movies don’t always crystallize into one, and if you’re looking for a credible crime thriller in which everyone behaves logically, Misericordia may not be for you. If, on the other hand, you’re looking for an exploration of repressed sexual desire and religious hypocrisy in backwoods France, Guiraudie’s strange and sober new film does the trick.","May 27, 2024"
Misericordia,2025,The New York Times,70,Wesley Morris,"Misericordia is film noir with the lights turned on. Even when its characters are working your nerves, it tickles. Guiraudie is playing those nerves like a harp.","Mar 20, 2025"
Misericordia,2025,Wall Street Journal,70,Zachary Barnes,"By its end, “Misericordia” emerges as a drama by turns chilling and absurd, with some of its twists daring us toward incredulity. Yet Mr. Guiraudie’s mix of mischief-making and straight-faced conviction keeps us continuously unsettled, and continuously curious.","Mar 20, 2025"
Misericordia,2025,Paste Magazine,68,Jim Vorel,"At times arrestingly suspenseful, at others bitterly funny, but often inert in its transitions, Misericordia is an occasionally confounding mixed bag, but one that stands out for the realistic recriminations of a place where grievances run deep and mercy comes with strings attached.","Mar 21, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,The Independent,100,Clarisse Loughrey,"While the supporting cast are impeccable across the board, it’s really Blanchett and Fassbender’s film to command, with performances that drip with old-school star power.","Mar 6, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,The Seattle Times,100,Katie Walsh,"Black Bag may be rooted in the mind, but it is inextricably connected to the heart, especially in matters of love and trust, betrayal and murder. That’s what makes a Soderbergh genre exercise such a deliciously satisfying cinematic morsel: It is pure fun, but also deeply layered with larger existential themes, making for a delightful romantic spy drama that cannot be missed.","Mar 12, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,New York Magazine (Vulture),100,Angelica Jade Bastien,"Black Bag is a tremendous example that a film need not be making an explicit political point or obsessed with the political dimensions of its narrative to be worthwhile cinema. A work can rise to this present moment by offering us rapture. This, too, is what movies are meant to accomplish.","Mar 14, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,The New Yorker,100,Justin Chang,"Soderbergh and Koepp, for their part, express their own fervent belief: in the seductive glamour of espionage and the magnetism of Blanchett’s and Fassbender’s interlocking gazes—which is to say, in the enveloping artifice and power of movies. Great is their faithfulness indeed.","Mar 14, 2025"

Black Bag,2025,The New York Times,90,Manohla Dargis,"By the time Pierce Brosnan shows up, you may find yourself giggling at the whole meta deliciousness of this enterprise.

Black Bag,2025,Arizona Republic,90,Bill Goodykoontz,"Black Bag, Steven Soderbergh’s outstanding new film, is sleek, cool, polished, smart, smooth — if Soderbergh were a thief, he’d leave no fingerprints.","Mar 13, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,Wall Street Journal,90,Kyle Smith,"Messrs. Soderbergh and Koepp have followed one of (Elmore) Leonard’s Laws—“Leave out the parts that people skip”—to construct an electric, fast-paced thriller that amounts to one climactic scene piled atop another.","Mar 14, 2025"

Black Bag,2025,The Associated Press,88,Jake Coyle,"Black Bag follows a run of agilely directed thrillers by Soderbergh made with screenwriter David Koepp. They are both at the height of their almost-too-easy powers; the script, especially, is peppered with delectable dialogue.","Mar 12, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,Chicago Sun-Times,88,Richard Roeper,"I’m not going to pretend I always knew exactly what everyone was talking about as we plunged ever deeper into the weeds of double-crossing and triple-crossing among a batch of mostly iniquitous secret agents, but it’s a zippy and darkly funny ride every step of the way. The dialogue jumps off the page, and the performances are universally brilliant.","Mar 13, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,Movie Nation,88,Roger Moore,"Koepp and Soderbergh make this as much about mistrust and fidelity in a marriage as it is about spies-gone-wrong. They keep their film intimate and interrogatory, giving it an old fashioned theatrical feel.","Mar 14, 2025"

Black Bag,2025,LarsenOnFilm,88,Josh Larsen,"Written by David Koepp, who also penned Soderbergh’s Kimi and Presence, Black Bag displays the twists and intrigue you’d expect from a top-rate spy flick, along with some scintillating dialogue. But it’s the movie’s intellectual provocation and formal invention that marks it among Soderbergh’s best work.","Mar 17, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,The Film Verdict,85,Alonso Duralde,"Black Bag is a not-quite-quotidian spy movie. The stakes are the fate of a relationship, not the fate of the world, and all the pieces come together to make human drama even more interesting than potential apocalypse.","Mar 6, 2025"

Black Bag,2025,Paste Magazine,80,Jesse Hassenger,"Without slackening its tension, Black Bag sometimes resembles a bitter comedy of manners, which are apparently also kept in the black bag for certain stretches.

Black Bag,2025,Time,80,Stephanie Zacharek,"Black Bag succeeds on its chilly wit, and on the cool, nervy appeal of its two stars. Blanchett strides through the movie with lioness grace; Fassbender makes George’s robotic use of logic seem like an aphrodisiac.","Mar 6, 2025"

Black Bag,2025,Empire,80,John Nugent,"Its pleasures lie in the dialogue, the twists, the reveals. It all leads to a delightful Agatha Christie-style drawing room denouement, in which the rat is exposed, their best-laid plans laid to waste.

Black Bag,2025,The Telegraph,80,Robbie Collin,"It positions spycraft as a hybrid of occult ritual and parlour game – and perhaps also a grand-scale working-through of deep-seated national jitters. Happily, it’s also enormous fun with it, and has your mind whirring to keep up with David Koepp’s devious screenplay, which gives itself a head start and waits until the very end before willingly surrendering the lead.","Mar 14, 2025"

Black Bag,2025,IndieWire,75,David Ehrlich,"If Black Bag denies us the kind of duplicitous confrontations that other versions of this story might take pains to savor, Soderbergh’s aversion to giving audiences what they want — and the severe angularity that he tends to offer us now instead — is almost as rewarding here as it was utterly indefensible in “Magic Mike’s Last Dance.”","Mar 12, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,San Francisco Chronicle,75,G.

On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,2025,The Hollywood Reporter,90,Lovia Gyarkye,"Perhaps what’s most impressive about On Becoming a Guinea Fowl is Nyoni’s respect for subtext. Her film doesn’t aim to be a guide, a balm or an ode to forgiveness. The director rejects the ease of over-explanation and allure of an exclusively reverential tone. She reaches for honesty, and what she uncovers is at once disquieting and deeply absorbing.","May 18, 2024"

On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,2025,Los Angeles Times,90,Robert Abele,"In its atmosphere of gnawing discomfort with imposed secrecy about bad men, “On Becoming a Guinea Fowl” is a uniquely dimensional work of character and temporality.
