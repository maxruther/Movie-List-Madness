Thelma (2024),Original-Cin,100,Liz Braun,"Thelma is really entertaining. The cast (which includes Malcolm McDowell) is very strong. The performance from Squibb, a 70-year vet of the industry and Oscar-nominated for her work in Nebraska, is fantastic, and Roundtree is likewise magnetic.","Jun 18, 2024"
Thelma (2024),The A.V. Club,100,Cindy White,"How often does a film come along that you can comfortably recommend to literally everyone in your life? Not often enough. For that reason alone, Thelma deserves to be celebrated.","Jun 20, 2024"
Thelma (2024),Washington Post,100,Ty Burr,Thelma is about the indomitable human urge to keep going and the hard-won wisdom to know when to heed time’s warnings. It’s a movie that rages against the dying of the light — at 30 mph.,"Jun 20, 2024"
Thelma (2024),TheWrap,90,Kristen Lopez,"Thelma is a totally pure delight that gives June Squibb a much-deserved leading role. Her and Roundtree are fabulously paired and Margolin’s script is breezy and sharp in equal measure. You’ll want to see this with your best friend, your parents, and, yes, your grandma.","Jan 19, 2024"
Thelma (2024),The Globe and Mail (Toronto),90,Sarah-Tai Black,"A tender comedy at heart, Thelma is a delightful romp that focuses on the different textures of the human experience and the poignant (and sometimes very silly) moments that come with it.","Jun 21, 2024"
Thelma (2024),New York Post,88,Johnny Oleksinski,Any plot greasing is quickly forgivable because of how damn delightful it is to be riding in the back of Squibb’s scooter. That this is the actress’ first leading role in a decades-long career is the greatest crime of all.,"Jan 29, 2024"
Thelma (2024),The Seattle Times,88,Moira Macdonald,"Filled with sweetly funny moments, “Thelma” is a perfect showcase for the delightfully wry Squibb, whose character constantly reminds us that you’re never too old to try something new, whether it’s takeout sushi or low-speed chasing after criminals.","Jun 20, 2024"

Thelma (2024),Observer,88,Rex Reed,"This is a feel-good comedy bordering on farce, but [Squibb] makes every scene and every line so natural that when you laugh, you’re reacting to genuine humor, not calculatedly constructed punch lines.","Jun 20, 2024"
Thelma (2024),RogerEbert.com,88,Brandon David Wilson,"Needless to say, the whole film rests on June Squibb's shoulders. She brings to the part 78 years of acting experience, which is a joy to watch.","Jun 20, 2024"
Thelma (2024),The Playlist,83,Gregory Ellwood,"Margolin’s directorial debut is often super entertaining with just enough style and patience to avoid the trappings of a broad, studio endeavor. It also has a ton to say about senior autonomy, aging, ageism (two very different things), and the bonds between family members, young and old.","Jan 19, 2024"
Thelma (2024),Entertainment Weekly,83,Devan Coggan,"Not every gag lands, but Thelma is the rare spoof that’s both laugh-out-loud funny and disarmingly sweet.","Jan 20, 2024"
Thelma (2024),Consequence,83,Liz Shannon Miller,"There are several sequences where the comedy of Thelma really sings, but if the film was just a parody, it would maybe be a funny yet rough watch.

Thelma (2024),The Guardian,80,Adrian Horton,"Squibb is as understatedly funny and commanding as you’d expect.

Thelma (2024),Screen Rant,80,Mae Abdulbaki,"There aren’t many films that can capture a character’s feisty spirit while still contending with the struggles and feelings of growing older. To that end, Thelma is a breath of fresh air, a crowd-pleasing film that knows exactly what it is and what it’s trying to accomplish. It does so with style and grace.","Feb 2, 2024"
Thelma (2024),Arizona Republic,80,Bill Goodykoontz,"It’s a heartfelt film, and Squib, finally leading a film at 94, makes it that much better.","Jun 18, 2024"
Thelma (2024),Los Angeles Times,80,Katie Walsh,"While the setting may be humble, Margolin captures the unlikely beauty of the Valley, and injects thrilling suspense into this yarn, one that transforms quotidian dramas — like making an unprotected left turn, or closing pop-up ads on a webpage — into nail-biting action sequences.","Jun 20, 2024"
Thelma (2024),Total Film,80,Kate Stables,"First-time writer/director Josh Margolin sharpens the film into a smart senior thriller, giving us tense geriatric POVs of the challenges that ensue (Thelma is seriously old, not the agile seventy-something of The G, another recent granny-get-your-gun outing).","Jul 11, 2024"
Thelma (2024),Empire,80,Laura Venning,"Surprisingly exciting and laugh-out-loud funny, Thelma is a warm-hearted joyride. If anything, it’ll make you really want to pick up the phone and call your own grandma.","Jul 16, 2024"
Thelma (2024),The Irish Times,80,Tara Brady,"Writer-director Josh Margolin, making his feature debut, based the eponymous character on his grandmother. The script, accordingly, is never patronising.","Jul 17, 2024"
Thelma (2024),Paste Magazine,75,Jacob Oller,"Like its absentminded hero, the film can sometimes get sidetracked right when things are getting good, wandering down schmaltzy or twee narrative paths. But when it lets Thelma (and Squibb) do her thing, the comedy is perfectly cute and a stellar showcase for what an actor’s late career can offer.","Jan 19, 2024"

Thelma (2024),Movie Nation,75,Roger Moore,The most adorable “action” pic of the summer is a senior citizen’s caper comedy that’s novel enough and clever enough that the fact that it also has something to say is merely the cherry on top of the cinematic sundae.,"Jun 14, 2024"

Thelma (2024),The Hollywood Reporter,70,David Rooney,"The film reflects on issues of aging and autonomy with a mostly light touch, its protagonist making a strong case for the enduring spirit of elderly folks too often infantilized by both society and their loved ones.","Jan 19, 2024"
Thelma (2024),Collider,70,Ross Bonaime,"Thelma could’ve been a one-note joke, but Margolin’s script makes being elderly a strength and not a weakness.","Jan 31, 2024"
Thelma (2024),Rolling Stone,70,David Fear,You won’t see the title character engage in Krav Maga with a gang of thugs or sprint across rooftops in Marrakesh (we’re assuming they’re saving that for the sequel). But you will witness Squibb step into the spotlight of leading what is technically an action movie and totally own it.,"Jun 18, 2024"

Thelma (2024),The New York Times,60,Jeannette Catsoulis,Margolin’s empathy for Thelma (he based the story on a scam perpetrated on his own grandmother) lends the film a sweetness and occasional poignancy that help mitigate much of the foolishness.,"Jun 20, 2024"
Thelma (2024),IGN,60,A.A. Dowd,"It’s nice to see June Squibb land a starring role for once, but her quest for revenge in this Sundance crowdpleaser is more cutesy than charming.","Jun 27, 2024"
Thelma (2024),Time Out,60,Phil de Semlyen,"Thelma is neither as funny nor as Marmite-y as Little Miss Sunshine, a kindred spirit in the quirky indie realm, but its light shines in myriad little character beats.","Jul 10, 2024"
Thelma (2024),The Guardian,60,Peter Bradshaw,"Squibb is however really good: no other casting is conceivable, and it is good to see her get the lead turn she deserves.","Jul 15, 2024"
Conclave (2024),The A.V. Club,100,Tomris Laffly,"A gradually swelling, deeply intellectual, and unexpectedly fun political thriller, Berger’s twisty film takes the audience behind the notoriously secretive closed doors of the Catholic Church for one of its most private processes: the election of a new pontiff.","Sep 1, 2024"
Conclave (2024),RogerEbert.com,100,Nell Minow,"Conclave is smart, provocative, sometimes funny, and determined to make us rethink our initial impressions. It challenges us to challenge ourselves and is wildly entertaining, one of the year’s standout films.","Oct 24, 2024"
Conclave (2024),USA Today,100,Brian Truitt,"The thriller is both a thought-provoking investigation into real-life themes and human flaws but also an undoubtedly entertaining exercise, one where the simple act of dropping off ballots becomes a crucial aspect of a scintillating, white-knuckle affair.","Oct 29, 2024"

Conclave (2024),Consequence,91,Liz Shannon Miller,"Watching brilliant actors face off over issues of idealism, pragmatism, and maybe occasionally faith makes for captivating viewing. Conclave even dares to make it a little fun. Which might be its most subversive element.","Oct 25, 2024"

Conclave (2024),Screen Rant,90,Graeme Guttmann,"Conclave is not trying to be some treatise on the state of the Catholic Church, nor is it saying anything new about modern religion. It's engrossing nonetheless, and it milks the titular event for every dramatic drop its worth.","Sep 11, 2024"

Conclave (2024),ABC News,90,Peter Travers,"Ralph Fiennes delivers a master class in acting in this juicy, jolting mystery thriller in which director Edward Berger uses the fictional election of a new pope in Rome to mirror America’s own dirty politics. What fun! And the drama of It will pin you to your seat","Oct 25, 2024"
Conclave (2024),We Got This Covered,90,Charlotte Simmons,"A pointed puzzle-box that never takes its finger off its stormy emotions, 'Conclave' is as softly sensational as it is sweepingly satisfying.","Oct 28, 2024"
Conclave (2024),New York Post,88,Johnny Oleksinski,"While I needle “Conclave” for being far from realistic, its meticulous detail is evidenced immediately by the ceremonial removal of the papal ring from the corpse and the sealing of his apartment. Visually, the entire film’s a stunner.","Sep 10, 2024"
Conclave (2024),Boston Globe,88,Odie Henderson,"Conclave is a massively entertaining slice of melodramatic excess, with actors who know they’re in a soap opera disguised as high drama. As a result, everyone plays their roles completely straight — and to great effect.","Oct 22, 2024"
Conclave (2024),The Associated Press,88,Lindsey Bahr,"Conclave is sure to ruffle some Catholic feathers — provocation is in its DNA. But for the rest of us, this juicy, smartly crafted thriller, is simply a great watch.","Oct 23, 2024"

Conclave (2024),Movie Nation,88,Roger Moore,"Conclave is a deliciously immersive experience, a narrative that commands our attention and expects our speculation even if it maintains a distance that allows it all to seem out-of-step, fusty and even darkly humorous at its most extreme.","Oct 28, 2024"

Conclave (2024),The Guardian,80,Benjamin Lee,"The nature of the twist, together with the high volume score, some crowd-pleasing gotchas and some sinister vaping remind us that Conclave is a glossily transferred airport novel first and a deeper drama about the world of religion second.","Sep 10, 2024"
Conclave (2024),New York Magazine (Vulture),80,Bilge Ebiri,"Berger’s film is adapted, quite faithfully, from Robert Harris’s 2016 novel, and it combines the pulp velocity of a great airport read with the gravitas of high drama.","Sep 12, 2024"

It’s quite the journey, and as unpersuasive as it is entertaining.","Oct 24, 2024"
Conclave (2024),Rolling Stone,80,David Fear,"Do not come to Conclave in search of some divine messages about power, corruption and lies percolating within a sacred space. Just embrace it for being the type of gobsmacking, pope-up-the-jams entertainment that will have you genuflecting with gratitude over its over-the-top ridiculousness.","Oct 25, 2024"
Conclave (2024),Time,80,Stephanie Zacharek,"In Berger’s hands, it all works a treat, right up to the movie’s shockeroo surprise ending. Berger’s 2022 All Quiet on the Western Front won the Best International Feature Oscar, and he guides this film, too, with a sure and steady hand.","Oct 28, 2024"

Conclave (2024),Time Out,80,Phil de Semlyen,Directed with real élan by Edward Berger – going two-for-two on literary adaptions after his take on All Quiet on the Western Front – Conclave is a film for the ’they don’t make ’em like they used to’ brigade.,"Nov 22, 2024"

Conclave (2024),The Irish Times,80,Donald Clarke,"Does it all add up? The cleaved-brow Fiennes, who does inner torture better than anyone, makes something believable of Lawrence’s battle for truth and integrity.

Conclave (2024),TheWrap,79,William Bibbiani,"Whenever the filmmaker’s emphasis is on the sinful humanity of these men of God, reducing them to Machiavellian backstabbers, it’s a satisfying and absorbing yarn.

Conclave (2024),Slashfilm,75,Witney Seibold,"Although it doesn't possess the hard-boiled, shifty-eyed salaciousness of a traditional whodunnit, ""Conclave"" is certainly in the spirit of a private investigator story.","Oct 23, 2024"
Conclave (2024),Observer,75,Oliver Jones,"While Berger’s film should be applauded for envisioning a way forward for the profoundly troubled and still deeply corrupt organization, by not more completely and honestly reckoning with the crimes of its past, its optimism for the future—while both deeply felt and dramatically conveyed—ultimately rings hollow.","Oct 23, 2024"

Conclave (2024),San Francisco Chronicle,75,Mick LaSalle,"Conclave is a fascinating drama about the personal and political machinations involved in the selection of a new pope.

Conclave (2024),Washington Post,75,Ty Burr,"It’s the kind of movie that some will deem important enough to merit end-of-year awards and others will find portentous enough to give them the giggles — again, not unpleasurably.","Oct 24, 2024"
Conclave (2024),ReelViews,75,James Berardinelli,"The movie is at its best when it feels like a Vatican riff on 12 Angry Men, a concept that is enough to keep things flowing smoothly until the frustratingly “Hollywood” events of the final 20 minutes.","Oct 28, 2024"
Conclave (2024),Los Angeles Times,70,Katie Walsh,"The richness of the filmmaking, including the powerful acting, obfuscates the fact that the story itself is a pretty thin and silly mystery with twists that cheapen the intellectual quandary at the center of the tale.","Oct 24, 2024"

Conclave (2024),Paste Magazine,67,Rory Doherty,"The traditional, closed-door design of the election invites an inherent layer of mystery and conspiracy, and the staggered voting process – the tallies of each vote are announced in front of the cardinals, giving them a brief recess to reconsider who is worth throwing their weight behind before having another go – provides an attractive structure for drama.","Oct 24, 2024"
Conclave (2024),The Daily Beast,65,Nick Schager,"Fine performances abound, including from Stanley Tucci and John Lithgow, but the film is ultimately at odds with itself, its handsome appearance and severe attitude clashing with its pulpy impulses.","Sep 10, 2024"

Conclave (2024),The New Yorker,60,Richard Brody,"Fiennes and Tucci, in particular, spin dialogue with athletic deftness, but they and the rest of the cast are burdened with embodying stock characters who exist only through a salient trait or two.

Tangerine (2015),The New York Times,100,Manohla Dargis,"Tangerine encompasses dizzying multitudes — it’s a neo-screwball chase flick with a dash of Rainer Werner Fassbinder — but mostly, movingly, it is a female-friendship movie about two people who each started life with an XY chromosome set.","Jul 9, 2015"
Tangerine (2015),New York Magazine (Vulture),100,David Edelstein,"What’s extraordinary about Tangerine is that it’s everything an entertaining, old-fashioned, mainstream Hollywood comedy should be but no longer is.

With Tangerine he continues to prove that by depicting these characters in all their flaws and majesty, movies can inspire awareness of our shared humanity. And make us laugh.","Jul 17, 2015"
Tangerine (2015),Wall Street Journal,80,Joe Morgenstern,The film is clearly not for everyone; sometimes it wasn’t for me. But it’s steadfastly nonjudgmental and wonderfully tender toward two searchers for new versions of old-fashioned love.,"Jul 9, 2015"
Tangerine (2015),Arizona Republic,80,Bill Goodykoontz,"Rodriguez and Taylor are terrific. Their confidence is infectious, yet they never let us forget the challenges their lives offer.","Jul 23, 2015"
Tangerine (2015),The Guardian,80,Peter Bradshaw,There’s real energy.,"Nov 15, 2015"
Tangerine (2015),CineVue,80,Patrick Gamble,"Poetic realism for a digital age, Tangerine also shares a lot of qualities with the cinema of Mike Leigh and Ken Loach. There's no cheap manipulation here and Baker's characters never come across as victims.","Nov 15, 2015"
Tangerine (2015),Austin Chronicle,78,Steve Davis,"Tangerine’s greatest accomplishment, however, lies with director Baker, who filmed the movie using an iPhone 5S. It’s an amazing achievement – the fluidity of the camerawork is exhilarating at times, the intimacy of the close-ups sometimes unsettling.","Jul 22, 2015"
Tangerine (2015),Slant Magazine,75,Ed Gonzalez,"Its triumph is primarily a matter of style, a visionary revelation every bit as expressionistic as its main character's electric sense of shade.","Jun 28, 2015"
Tangerine (2015),Movie Nation,75,Roger Moore,"A feisty, funny, down-and-dirty farce as nasty as a Supreme Court dissent, as timely as a Jenner magazine cover.","Jul 7, 2015"
Tangerine (2015),TheWrap,75,Inkoo Kang,"The film bustles along through a series of reveals – a storytelling technique that can lose an audience’s sympathy or suspension of disbelief pretty fast, but which works flawlessly here because the filmmakers and the performers know exactly who their characters are and what kind of world they live in.","Jul 9, 2015"
Tangerine (2015),RogerEbert.com,75,Matt Zoller Seitz,"As written by Sean Baker and Chris Bergoch and directed by Baker, it's assured and immensely likable, and truly independent in story and style.","Jul 10, 2015"
Tangerine (2015),Washington Post,75,Ann Hornaday,"As one character observes in Tangerine, Los Angeles is “a beautifully wrapped lie.” Baker has created a fitting homage to artifice and the often tawdry, tender realities that lie beneath.","Jul 16, 2015"
Tangerine (2015),St. Louis Post-Dispatch,75,Calvin Wilson,"Although the story of Sin-Dee and Alexandra might have benefited from a bit more structure, it’s a window into a world of which many people are unaware — but a world that has its share of dreamers.","Aug 6, 2015"
Tangerine (2015),The New Yorker,70,Richard Brody,"Baker revels in the power of clichés and the generic energy of his low-fi cinematography, which is done with a cell phone. The results are picturesque and anecdotal.","Jul 7, 2015"
Tangerine (2015),Boston Globe,63,Peter Keough,Subtlety and irony are not among the film’s virtues.,"Jul 16, 2015"
Tangerine (2015),New York Daily News,60,Jordan Hoffman,"Tangerine offers a warts-and-all depiction of a subculture seldom treated with respect by straight society. The movie handles it in a sincere way that’s entertaining, too.","Jul 9, 2015"
Tangerine (2015),New Orleans Times-Picayune,40,Mike Scott,"Like the rest of the film, it's has its laughs and it has its emotion, just not enough of either.","Sep 18, 2015"
