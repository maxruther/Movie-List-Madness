I'M STILL HERE,2024,The New York Times,100,Alissa Wilkinson,"I’m Still Here does not present as a simple polemic about a historical and political situation, and that’s the secret to its global appeal. It’s also a moving portrait of how politics disrupts and reshapes the domestic sphere, and how solidarity, community and love are the only viable path toward living in tragedy. And it warns us to mistrust anyone who tries to erase or rewrite the past.","Jan 16, 2025"
I'M STILL HERE,2024,RogerEbert.com,100,Robert Daniels,"It’s difficult to fully contextualize how incredible Torres is here; she matches the film’s silent grief by keenly deploying her character’s internal angst into her slender frame.

I'M STILL HERE,2024,Washington Post,100,Ty Burr,Walter Salles’s “I’m Still Here” is an epic within an epic: a teeming family drama contained within the melodrama of a country going insane.,"Jan 23, 2025"
I'M STILL HERE,2024,Original-Cin,100,Liam Lacey,"In I’m Still Here, Walter Salles’ first feature film in a dozen years, the Brazilian director manages an impressive feat of teleporting, placing the viewer inside the cheerful chaos of a large Brazilian family.","Jan 30, 2025"

I'M STILL HERE,2024,The Observer (UK),100,Wendy Ide,"The realisation that her husband is gone for good is a gradual process that plays out, largely without words, on Torres’s face, in a performance of extraordinary intelligence and emotional complexity.","Feb 26, 2025"
I'M STILL HERE,2024,The A.V. Club,91,Manuel Betancourt,"Heartrending yet never maudlin, I’m Still Here is a humanist drama that, in shining a light on insidious injustice, becomes a balm to warn and warm its audiences in equal measure.","Jan 14, 2025"

I'M STILL HERE,2024,Chicago Tribune,88,Michael Phillips,"Torres is one of those screen veterans with a surgically precise relationship to the camera, never pushing, always searching for emotions expressed even as they’re being hidden, or held in check, because someone’s watching.","Jan 27, 2025"

I'M STILL HERE,2024,Boston Globe,88,Odie Henderson,"Director Walter Salles returns to the political filmmaking he employed in the 2004 Che Guevara film, “The Motorcycle Diaries.” Like that film, this one follows a protagonist who becomes an activist after being jarred by political events.","Jan 30, 2025"

I'M STILL HERE,2024,Rolling Stone,80,David Fear,"What’s remarkable is how [Torres] never overplays anything, or goes for easy histrionics and rending of garments even when the movie itself becomes heavy-handed in the back half.","Jan 17, 2025"
I'M STILL HERE,2024,TheWrap,80,Chase Hutchinson,"As Salles shows us, such a seismic loss spans many generations just as it does entire histories that are still being written. We must then always remember the people, their individual stories, and what it was that they endured so that others may never have to do so again.","Jan 21, 2025"

I'M STILL HERE,2024,IndieWire,75,Leila Latif,"The idea of them getting justice never feels on the table, but the film instead is a path out of the madness of a system where to simply have what happened to their father admitted would fill some of the void he has left behind.","Sep 2, 2024"

I'M STILL HERE,2024,Screen Rant,70,Mae Abdulbaki,"I’m Still Here is an evocative, nuanced portrait of family and the lasting imprint of politics.","Jan 25, 2025"
I'M STILL HERE,2024,The New Yorker,70,Justin Chang,"It was shrewd of the screenwriters, Murilo Hauser and Heitor Lorega, to stick so closely to Eunice’s perspective, trusting the audience to identify with her uncertainty, her vulnerability, and her instinctive urge to protect her children. But I’m Still Here has its own share of tactical evasions, and its dramatic caginess winds up blunting its own emotional force.","Jan 30, 2025"

I'M STILL HERE,2024,Empire,60,Gavia Baker-Whitelaw,"This drama is a little too sedate to make its mark, but director Walter Salles delivers a sensitive portrait of Eunice Paiva's family life during a period of traumatic upheaval.","Feb 19, 2025"
I'M STILL HERE,2024,The Playlist,58,Marshall Shaffer,"Given the unhurried pacing and general underplaying of the situation’s gravity, the film feels like visiting a museum exhibit rather than living through a flashpoint of history.

I'M STILL HERE,2024,The Film Stage,50,Savina Petkova,"On this occasion Salles has somehow failed to find the right cinematic framework for this biopic storytelling. The film feels uncalibrated, but not in the free-flowing, depth-exploring, liberated kind of way.","Sep 2, 2024"

THE ROOM NEXT DOOR,2024,The New York Times,90,Alissa Wilkinson,"Often movies ask what makes life worth living; this one asks what makes life worth leaving. It is a controversial subject, both in the movie and in the real world, and the film doesn’t treat it lightly.","Dec 19, 2024"

THE ROOM NEXT DOOR,2024,The Seattle Times,88,Moira Macdonald,"Ultimately, The Room Next Door is as much about love as it is about death — not the romantic kind of love, but the sort in which two friends hold each other up (quite literally, as Martha takes Ingrid’s arm during their walks) and give each other what they need, selflessly. Its final, magical moment finds uncanny beauty in sadness.","Jan 9, 2025"
THE ROOM NEXT DOOR,2024,Entertainment Weekly,83,Maureen Lee Lenker,"Even with its preoccupation with death, The Room Next Door is not a dour film.

THE ROOM NEXT DOOR,2024,Vanity Fair,80,Richard Lawson,"The film is not aiming to depress its audience, though. It is instead cathartic and energizing to witness these dire topics chewed over and spun into delicate poetry.

THE ROOM NEXT DOOR,2024,BBC,80,Nicholas Barber,"The Room Next Door isn't a weighty philosophical work – as mature as it is, it still has glimmers of cheeky humour and campy melodrama.

THE ROOM NEXT DOOR,2024,Total Film,80,Jane Crowther,"Pedro Almodóvar fans may be wrongfooted by the writer/director’s first full-length English-language feature, an atypically austere entry in his canon that’s nevertheless as vivid and haunting as much of his other work.","Oct 7, 2024"

THE ROOM NEXT DOOR,2024,Film Threat,75,Maggie Roberts,"The Room Next Door lacks the transgressive quality that initially endeared me to Almodóvar’s films, especially his early work. Perhaps it is a reflection of the director’s style and a renewed interest in the philosophy of death and dying as he gets older. While it’s still worth a watch, the movie leaves me wanting more, and not necessarily in a good way.","Oct 23, 2024"
THE ROOM NEXT DOOR,2024,The Associated Press,75,Jake Coyle,"What absolutely, undoubtedly does work is Moore and Swinton together. If some of the more melodramatic or crime-movie flourishes feel forced, the central relationship of “The Room Next Door” is consistently provocative.","Dec 18, 2024"

THE ROOM NEXT DOOR,2024,New York Magazine (Vulture),70,Alison Willmore,"The Room Next Door is an alternately rapturous and ponderous meditation on mortality, though in a very Almodóvarian fashion, that exploration comes by way of a fantasy of set directing one’s own death, down to the moment, location, and outfit worn.","Sep 2, 2024"
THE ROOM NEXT DOOR,2024,ABC News,70,Peter Travers,"Spain’s legendary director Pedro Almodóvar freights his first full-length feature in English with tangled subplots, but nothing can dim the artistry of Tilda Swinton and Julianne Moore who make this death-fixated tale of old friends in crisis feel thrillingly alive.","Jan 3, 2025"

THE ROOM NEXT DOOR,2024,Paste Magazine,66,Jesse Hassenger,"With his careful attention to the controlled emoting from both Swinton and Moore, so free of showy tearjerking or breakdowns, Almodóvar humanely and pointedly avoids turning The Room Next Door into an issue movie dedicated to assisted suicide.

THE ROOM NEXT DOOR,2024,LarsenOnFilm,63,Josh Larsen,"Much of what makes a great Pedro Almodovar film can be found in The Room Next Door: a layered narrative, a thoughtful color scheme, a focus on women, and an intense interest in sex and/or death.

WALTZ WITH BASHIR,2008,Empire,100,Dan Jolin,"A bravura documentary which balances the personal and the political as it peers into the First Lebanon War, its animated approach never feeling like a novelty. Astonishing, unforgettable: you have to see it.",
WALTZ WITH BASHIR,2008,Los Angeles Times,100,Kenneth Turan,"Provocative, hallucinatory, incendiary, this devastating animated documentary is unlike any Israeli film you've seen. More than that, in its seamless mixing of the real and the surreal, the personal and the political, animation and live action, it's unlike any film you've seen, period.",
WALTZ WITH BASHIR,2008,Wall Street Journal,100,Joe Morgenstern,"An absolute stunner, a feature-length animated documentary, from Israel, in which the force of moving drawings amplifies eerily powerful accounts of war, shaky remembrance and rock-solid repression.",
WALTZ WITH BASHIR,2008,New York Magazine (Vulture),100,David Edelstein,It has taken an animated film to go where live-action dramas and even documentaries haven't--to tickle our synapses and slip into our bloodstream.,
WALTZ WITH BASHIR,2008,San Francisco Chronicle,100,Jonathan Curiel,The best movie of 2008? The most revealing war film ever made? The greatest animated feature to come out of Israel? All these descriptions could apply to Waltz With Bashir.,
WALTZ WITH BASHIR,2008,Entertainment Weekly,100,Lisa Schwarzbaum,Waltz With Bashir has transcended the definitions of ''cartoon'' or ''war documentary'' to be classified as its own brilliant invention.,

WALTZ WITH BASHIR,2008,Miami Herald,88,Rene Rodriguez,"Waltz With Bashir isn't only a harrowing anti-war plea, it is also an eloquent and deeply moving argument that it is critical to never forget human atrocity, lest the past be repeated.",
WALTZ WITH BASHIR,2008,Boston Globe,88,Ty Burr,"Waltz With Bashir not only breathes but it howls - and sobs and curses and croons and, in the end, when sound proves useless in the face of calamity, falls into awful silence.",
WALTZ WITH BASHIR,2008,Chicago Sun-Times,88,Roger Ebert,"Folman is an Israeli documentarian who has not worked in animation. Now he uses it as the best way to reconstruct memories, fantasies, hallucinations, possibilities, past and present. This film would be nearly impossible to make any other way.",
WALTZ WITH BASHIR,2008,Variety,80,Leslie Felperin,"It's these surreal touches, deployed with tactical restraint, that make the picture extraordinary and convey the febrile atmosphere of warfare, where by fear, horror -- and later guilt -- distort and distend perception and memory.",
WALTZ WITH BASHIR,2008,New York Daily News,80,Elizabeth Weitzman,"This animated documentary, from former Israeli soldier Ari Folman, blends both tactics to devastating effect. Perhaps only animation could give us the distance that makes his subject bearable: the personal cost of his own participation in the 1982 Lebanon War.",
WALTZ WITH BASHIR,2008,Village Voice,80,J. Hoberman,"Ari Folman's broodingly original Waltz With Bashir -- one of the highlights of the last New York Film Festival -- is a documentary that seems only possible, not to mention bearable, as an animated feature.",
WALTZ WITH BASHIR,2008,The New Yorker,80,Anthony Lane,"Ari Folman, the director of Waltz with Bashir, has made a movie so unusual that it overflows any box in which you try to contain it. Call it an adult psycho-documentary combat cartoon and you're halfway there.",
WALTZ WITH BASHIR,2008,Film Threat,80,Scott Mendelson,"The tragic, violent true-life tale that concerns Waltz with Bashir is rendered even more powerful in animated form than it would likely have in life-action.",
WALTZ WITH BASHIR,2008,Chicago Reader,80,Andrea Gronvall,"Animation may be the ideal medium for replicating dreams, and in this unsettling feature by Ari Folman it also proves well suited to autobiography.",
WALTZ WITH BASHIR,2008,The A.V. Club,75,Tasha Robinson,"The trouble with Bashir's extraordinary technique is that it lacks the confrontational realism of live footage; the extreme stylization of the animation can be distancing, making it hard to relate the images to real events and people. But that's also part of Folman's point.",
WALTZ WITH BASHIR,2008,The Globe and Mail (Toronto),75,Rick Groen,"Profound, and profoundly affecting.",
WALTZ WITH BASHIR,2008,USA Today,75,Claudia Puig,"This is a powerful, poignant and provocative film, told in an unconventional and effective fashion.",
WALTZ WITH BASHIR,2008,The Hollywood Reporter,60,Peter Brunette,"The chosen style of animation leads to a distracting choppiness that renders the movements, gestures and facial expressions of the interviewees unconvincing. The other problem is that, memory naturally being something that returns in fits and starts, the film is rarely able to sustain any consistent narrative thrust.",
TIME PASSAGES,2024,RogerEbert.com,88,Matt Zoller Seitz,"I haven’t seen anything quite like it before. That alone makes it worth seeing, as long as you accept the proposition that a movie like this is unique, in some ways beyond genre labels, and feeling its way towards the right flow and shape as it goes.","Feb 3, 2025"
THE SACRIFICE,1986,BBC,100,Jonathan Trout,"It is a difficult film - slow-paced, unashamedly theatrical and heavily laden with philosophy – yet a profoundly satifying one: a rewarding display of filmmaking mastery that forms a mystical and enigmatic coda to a legendary career.",
THE SACRIFICE,1986,Chicago Sun-Times,100,Roger Ebert,"The Sacrifice is not the sort of movie most people will choose to see, but those with the imagination to risk it may find it rewarding.",
THE SACRIFICE,1986,The Guardian,100,Peter Bradshaw,"It is brilliant and audacious, with one of the most extraordinary final sequences in modern cinema, and all in a manner which Hollywood in the succeeding decade would learn to call ""high concept"".",
THE SACRIFICE,1986,LarsenOnFilm,100,Josh Larsen,"Like much of the filmmaker’s work (not to mention Bergman’s), The Sacrifice is haunted by the gap between human yearning and ultimate understanding, between the way things are and the way we long for them to be.",
THE SACRIFICE,1986,TV Guide Magazine,100,Staff (Not Credited),"THE SACRIFICE is about a number of things, none obvious and none remaining wholly consistent from one viewing to the next; it is a poetic vision, filled with the symbolism peculiar to Tarkovsky's imagination. It is also a visually stunning, hauntingly beautiful, brilliant piece of art.",
THE SACRIFICE,1986,Chicago Tribune,100,Michael Wilmington,"As he was dying, Tarkovsky fashioned this great valedictory about a family in the first stages of nuclear apocalypse and a father's ultimate sacrifice. [31 Jan 2003, p.C4]",
THE SACRIFICE,1986,Total Film,100,Staff (Not Credited),"For all its Swedish trimmings, the long, syrup-slow takes are unmistakably Tarkovsky’s, and it’s these that provide this arthouse disaster movie with its mesmerising power.",
THE SACRIFICE,1986,The New Yorker,90,Richard Brody,"The blend of midlife crisis and existential terror is reminiscent of the films of Ingmar Bergman, but Tarkovsky makes it a world of his own.",

THE SACRIFICE,1986,Los Angeles Times,90,Kevin Thomas,"By the time “The Sacrifice” comes full circle it emerges itself as a symbolic gesture of great emotional impact. We may share Alexander’s sense of impotence, but Tarkovsky turns such feelings into a work of art.",
THE SACRIFICE,1986,The New York Times,80,Walter Goodman,"It may not be your glass of tea; it's a tall glass, through which events are seen murkily. Those who stay with it, however, may find rewards in burst after burst of beauty and even a glimmer of meaning.",
THE SACRIFICE,1986,Paste Magazine,80,Staff (Not Credited),"The few insecurities in the filmmaking, which stick out in contrast to his Russian works, are easily overlooked by how masterful other scenes are and the impressiveness of the imagery.",

THE SACRIFICE,1986,Chicago Reader,80,Jonathan Rosenbaum,"As with Nostalghia, Tarkovsky’s previous work of exile, it’s possible to balk at the filmmaker’s pretensions and antiquated sexual politics and yet be overwhelmed by his mastery and originality, as well as the conviction of his sincerity.",
THE SACRIFICE,1986,Empire,80,Nick Dawson,As involving and intellectually rich as all Tarkovsky's work.,
THE SACRIFICE,1986,The Observer (UK),80,Philip French,"This humourless, portentous, beautifully made and exquisitely acted movie won the Special Jury Prize at Cannes, though when the men in white coats came to take Josephson away, some sardonic observers thought they'd come for Tarkovsky. [12 Jan 2003, p.8]",
THE SACRIFICE,1986,Slant Magazine,75,Carson Lund,"In Andrei Tarkovsky’s The Sacrifice, the distance from hope to despair is a short jump—a chasm crossed with the help of something so immediate as a television transmission.",
THE SACRIFICE,1986,Time Out,60,Wally Hammond,"However great is Tarkovsky’s mastery of mise-en-scène, or astounding his use of sound composition, it appears dehumanised and not a little egocentric, closer to a study of madness and self-delusion than, as I believe Tarkovsky hoped, an illustration of the power of faith and self-sacrifice.",
THE SACRIFICE,1986,The A.V. Club,60,Scott Tobias,"Though bookended by extraordinarily powerful scenes that play off a potent religious metaphor, the middle section sinks into a morass of ill-defined relationships and uneven performances, which may be blamed in part on culture clash.",

CLOSE UP,1990,Time Out,100,Keith Uhlich,"The meanings of Close-Up shift, subtly and profoundly, with every viewing; the only certainty is that its rewards are boundless.",
CLOSE UP,1990,The A.V. Club,100,Noel Murray,"From the outset, the director lets us know that this won’t be some sensationalistic crime story. Close-Up is more about the power of images, and how what’s on the screen at any given moment can hold our attention completely, even if it has nothing to do with “the story.”",
CLOSE UP,1990,LarsenOnFilm,100,Josh Larsen,Does Close-Up reveal the truth? I’d prefer to say it reveals the beauty of distortion.,

CLOSE UP,1990,Time Out,100,Geoff Andrew,"It's enormously intelligent stuff, witty, poignant and thoroughly engrossing, and ends with one of the sharpest, funniest deconstructions of film form ever shot. Absolutely wonderful.",
CLOSE UP,1990,Village Voice,90,Michael Atkinson,"Like nearly every other Kiarostami film, Close-Up takes questions about movies and makes them feel like questions of life and death.",
CLOSE UP,1990,The New York Times,90,Stephen Holden,"It is Mr. Sabzian's poignancy that makes ""Close-Up"" much more than a clever reflection on film-versus-life as an endless hall of mirrors.",
CLOSE UP,1990,The New Yorker,90,Richard Brody,"In Kiarostami’s furiously clear view, religious dogma suppresses the eye’s observations through the dictate of the word; his calmly unwavering images, with their wry humor and generous sympathy, have the force of a steadfast resistance.",

CLOSE UP,1990,Los Angeles Times,80,Dennis LIm,"Close-Up is perhaps the emblematic work of the so-called Iranian New Wave, summing up its methods and preoccupations and also bringing together two of its key figures, Kiarostami and Mohsen Makhmalbaf.",
CLOSE UP,1990,The Seattle Times,75,John Hartl,"""There's nothing about this place worth filming,"" insists one character, but Kiarostami always comes up with something: a Tati-like scene in which a canister rolls down a street, all but waiting to be kicked, and several exotic glimpses of urban life, including a turkey salesman who carries a couple of unplucked birds through the Tehran streets.

CHILDREN OF HEAVEN,1997,Christian Science Monitor,100,David Sterritt,This modestly produced family drama has all the poignancy and humor associated with today's vibrant Iranian film industry.,
CHILDREN OF HEAVEN,1997,The Guardian,100,Peter Bradshaw,"This is a pellucid and gentle film, made with the simplicity and grace of a children's tale and yet its humour, emotional clarity and directness speak directly to adults and children alike - and the pre-teen principals shoulder an adult burden of performance.",
CHILDREN OF HEAVEN,1997,The A.V. Club,90,Joshua Klein,Majidi masterfully balances the serious subtext with entertaining vignettes.,
CHILDREN OF HEAVEN,1997,LarsenOnFilm,88,Josh Larsen,"Children of Heaven is a simple film – it has bold, childlike colors and a narrative that turns on unremarkable, everyday events – yet Majidi and his young actors invest it with such basic truth about the inner lives of children that the movie feels as big as the universe.",
CHILDREN OF HEAVEN,1997,Chicago Reader,80,Lisa Alspector,"One problem leads to another, but because the children's points of view are so powerfully rendered, the plot of this elegant and lightly magical-realist 1997 drama never seems merely coincidental.",
CHILDREN OF HEAVEN,1997,Variety,80,Dennis Harvey,"Much humor and suspense is wrung from incidents that would be minuscule from anything but a child’s p.o.v., many repeated until they become ingenious running gags.",
CHILDREN OF HEAVEN,1997,Austin Chronicle,78,Marjorie Baumgarten,"The poverty that is at the heart of the situation is in prominent relief, yet there is a happiness about their lives that defies sheer gloss. Here is a brother and sister who truly love each other and are bonded by their complicity.",
CHILDREN OF HEAVEN,1997,San Francisco Chronicle,75,Peter Stack,"Haunting in its charm, Children of Heaven opens a window on both contemporary Tehran and the hopeful heart of childhood.  This lovely, amusing film deserves a big audience -- especially families. It touches on the innocence of children with tremendous affection.",
CHILDREN OF HEAVEN,1997,BBC,60,Michael Thomson,Certainly the youngsters in Children of Heaven respond well to the direction of Majid Majidi and give off emotions and thoughts in such an unmannered way that many proper actors could learn loads.,
CHILDREN OF HEAVEN,1997,The New York Times,50,Janet Maslin,"In Children of Heaven, life is sweet despite countless hardships, and no reality beyond the economic intrudes upon a fairy tale atmosphere. Only through heavy-handed emphasis does the quest for new sneakers take on any greater meaning.",
CHILDREN OF HEAVEN,1997,Entertainment Weekly,50,Owen Gleiberman,The plot feels less like a realistic dilemma than it does a willed exercise in neorealist catharsis — a way of inviting Western audiences to bask in their materialist ”empathy.”,
CHILDREN OF HEAVEN,1997,Village Voice,30,Michael Atkinson,"Clumsily staged (a bike accident any 15-year-old Super-8 maven could’ve cut better), lit like a soap opera, and acted with all the bribed relish of a peanut butter commercial, Majidi’s movie is merely the simplistic bid being made by every national industry impatient for mass audience attention. Gallingly, it may succeed.",
