Gladiator (2000),ReelViews,88,James Berardinelli,"Gladiator is designed not just to entertain, but to enthrall. It draws audiences in and immerses them in a reality that is not their own. A boisterous reaction is expected every time the protagonist defies the odds and wins a conflict, or changes the tide of battle in his favor. This is filmmaking on a grand scale.",
Gladiator (2000),Mr. Showbiz,84,Cody Clark,"Combining a seething physicality with enough weary nobility and tightly checked rage for a dozen wronged heroes, (Crowe) provides the movie's vital center of gravity without looming over his co-stars.",

Gladiator (2000),Wall Street Journal,80,Joe Morgenstern,"The whole enterprise rests on Mr. Crowe's armor-clad shoulders, and he carries it remarkably well.",
Gladiator (2000),Empire,80,Ian Nathan,"While it's all grand opera, and driven by sweeping gestures and pompous, overwritten dialogue, it is prone to plain silliness - especially in granting us the big showdown at the close. But the sheer dynamism of the action, coupled with Hans Zimmer's lavish score and the forcefield of Crowe, still makes this a fiercesome competitor in the summer movie stakes.",
Gladiator (2000),Miami Herald,75,Rene Rodriguez,"Lacks emotional depth and sweep -- but the movie still delivers the type of rousing, large-scale adventure that marked the best films of its kind",
Gladiator (2000),Portland Oregonian,75,Shawn Levy,"Frequently gory, often talky, almost always watchable, never quite thrilling, Gladiator is a cold and big film that mixes solid acting with cheesy digital effects and sweaty action with stultifying chatter.",

Wicked (2024),San Francisco Chronicle,100,Carla Meyer,"Fueled by exquisite performances from Tony winner Erivo (“The Color Purple”), as Elphaba, or the Wicked Witch of the West, and Grammy winner Grande as Glinda the Good Witch, “Wicked” is the best movie musical in years, representing a rare instance when performances, visuals and songs are of equally high quality.","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),i,100,Francesca Steele,It joyfully expands on the source material with extended musical numbers and astute childhood flashbacks in a combination that will delight committed Ozians and newcomers alike.,"Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),The Playlist,100,Manuel Betancourt,"Chu’s film is a triumph. An all-around delight. A colorful concoction sure to satiate fans, new and old alike. The film delivers both winking nods to the original stage production and finds novel ways of making its iconic numbers sing on screen, all while making the best use of live singing in recent memory.","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),Wall Street Journal,100,Kyle Smith,"The plot is so rich and eventful, and the script so witty, that the movie doesn’t drag once the extended flashback starts. Moreover, every moment is eye candy. The screen bursts with whimsical costumes (by Paul Tazewell) and sets (Nathan Crowley is the production designer), and all of the important roles are impeccably cast.","Nov 21, 2024"
Wicked (2024),Original-Cin,91,Thom Ernst,"Wicked can at times feel like a movie that’s one brick short of a road. But when all is said and sung, it’s still a road paved in gold.","Nov 21, 2024"

Wicked (2024),Variety,90,Peter Debruge,"Instead of feeling bloated, Wicked has found its ideal form, where every frame comes crammed with the kind of detail that could easily have been distracting, had a lesser talent than Cynthia Erivo been asked to carry it.","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),Collider,90,Jeff Ewing,"Wicked defies gravity for a soaring, beautifully sung return to Oz with wonderful vibrancy and a true sense of scale.","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),The Hollywood Reporter,90,David Rooney,"Grande and Erivo give Stephen Schwartz’s songs — comedy numbers, introspective ballads, power anthems — effortless spontaneity. They help us buy into the intrinsic musical conceit that these characters are bursting into song to express feelings too large for spoken words, not just mouthing lyrics and trilling melodies that someone spent weeks cleaning up in a studio.","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),IGN,90,Alyssa Mora,"Wicked is a well-oiled machine in the hands of Jon M. Chu. This film adaptation epitomizes what modern movie musicals can and should be, embracing its source material while cleverly translating it to screen. Tear-jerking performances by Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo make the movie, playing to their individual strengths to bring to life the rapport between Glinda and Elphaba, who’ll go on to become the good and wicked witches of Wizard of Oz fame. If as many people love this film as much as I did, Wicked will undoubtedly immortalize the Grande and Erivo in movie musical history.","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),The Daily Beast,90,Kevin Fallon,"Wicked is maximalist by every definition of the word, a whimsical, visual feast with top-to-bottom Movie Star performances that explode off the screen. But, under the delicate hand of maestro Jon M. Chu, it’s also grounded in a way that stirs you—brain, heart, courage, and all—in thrilling new ways that deepen and enrich the musical fans love.","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),Slate,90,Dana Stevens,"Despite the movie’s arguably excessive run time, it takes seriously its mandate to keep the audience not just entertained but dazzled.","Nov 20, 2024"
Wicked (2024),ABC News,90,Peter Travers,"How do I love the film version of the smash Broadway musical, let me count the ways, starting with the way Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande set the screen ablaze as frenemy witches and sets, costumes and songs to die for. Seeing this joyous eruption once is just not enough.","Nov 22, 2024"
Wicked (2024),We Got This Covered,90,Demi Phillips,"A brightly colored extravaganza, 'Wicked' is a monumental feat in the stage-to-screen lineage, with stunning sets, sharp choreography, and delightful musical numbers. Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande gracefully lead the film to great heights, and Jon M. Chu's tasteful direction raises hopes for 'Part Two.'","Nov 25, 2024"
Wicked (2024),The Seattle Times,88,Moira Macdonald,"This magic musical seems made for film, full of gloriously elaborate sets — can I please move into that dorm room, or at least borrow a few pieces from Glinda’s mountain of pink luggage? — and action sequences that a stage production can’t duplicate.","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),Washington Post,88,Ty Burr,"The production numbers in “Wicked” are garish and cluttered, but they have snap and a pleasing sense of unified mass movement; their effect on the eyeballs is somewhere between an assault and a massage.","Nov 20, 2024"
Wicked (2024),Paste Magazine,85,Jim Vorel,"This film is as good as this project could ever hope to be, and it bodes well that Part Two will live up to everything that’s been set up here. When granted the chance to see them back-to-back, we just may, as the song goes, all be changed for the better. After this first act, it’s already safe to claim that Wicked is frickin’ Oz-some.","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),Film Threat,85,Alan Ng,"Wicked: Part 1 is an incredible adaptation that captures the core of what fans adore about the stage musical while offering its own cinematic flourishes. Despite a few pacing hiccups, Jon M. Chu’s direction and the cast’s passionate performances create a magical journey worth experiencing.","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),Consequence,83,Paolo Ragusa,"The film is effective at capturing what made the original musical so beloved, and in turn, will belong to a new generation of kids — those kids who might then envision themselves cathartically singing “Popular” or “Defying Gravity” on stage, just as Ariana Grande had as a child.","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),The Atlantic,83,Shirley Li,The resulting adaptation satisfyingly combines the grandiosity of a musical and the intimacy of filmmaking.,"Dec 2, 2024"
Wicked (2024),Arizona Republic,80,Bill Goodykoontz,"Wicked isn’t the best movie you’ll see this year, but it’s almost certainly the most movie. … There’s not a frame wasted, not a second of down time. It’s a little like having dessert for dinner, as well as for the appetizer and dessert again, too. And it’s fun, a good time at the movies.","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),TheWrap,80,William Bibbiani,"The story’s playful, subversive reinterpretation of 'The Wizard of Oz' as a work of propaganda, designed to obfuscate the true story of how political dissidents and minority groups are demonized by fascist con artists who trade in theatricality instead of competence, is fully developed and still (to our collective dismay) incredibly salient.","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),The Times,80,Kevin Maher,"Hollywood finally delivers a worthy successor to The Wizard of Oz with this musical adaptation, starring the superb Erivo as Elphaba and a startlingly good Ariana Grande as Glinda.","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),Vanity Fair,80,Richard Lawson,"Wicked succeeds because of some unreproducible, lightning in a bottle convergences—of director, stars, craftspeople, and high-status material. But Wicked also makes a broader case for patience and careful thought, for grand ambition honed over the course of many years. In order to defy gravity, gravity must first be understood.","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),Time Out,80,Phil de Semlyen,You’d need an army of flying monkeys to find a Wicked fan with a grumble about this film.,"Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),The Guardian,80,Peter Bradshaw,What an enjoyable spectacle it is.,"Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),Screen Daily,80,Fionnuala Halligan,"It’s so doggedly faithful to the show, so emphatically orchestrated and so powered by Cynthia Erivo’s exceptional performance, that resistance to its 169 minutes of theme park magic becomes futile. This is a film that leaves nothing in the wings — except for an entire second act, and a sequel which has already been shot.","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),Empire,80,Helen O'Hara,"Chu amps up the colour and spectacle to extraordinary, almost overwhelming heights, but the real magic comes from Erivo and Grande as the frenemies at the story’s heart.","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),Looper,80,Cynthia Vinney,"For the most part, the musical fires on all cylinders, so we're off to a good start.","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),Little White Lies,80,Fatima Sheriff,"It has been a long production journey, but reaching the end of this winding yellow brick road has yielded movie gold.","Nov 21, 2024"
Wicked (2024),NME,80,Nick Levine,"By the end, you won’t quite be levitating off your seat but you’ll definitely be enchanted enough to stream the soundtrack on the way home. Funny, colourful and full of empathy for outsiders, this film really is the Shiz.","Nov 21, 2024"
Wicked (2024),The Observer (UK),80,Wendy Ide,"With its all too timely themes of bullying, corrupt leaders and the demonisation of difference, this is a movie that promises a froth of pink and green escapism but delivers considerably more in the way of depth and darkness.","Nov 26, 2024"
Wicked (2024),Chicago Sun-Times,75,Richard Roeper,"It’s sweet and lovely work, but at times lacking in the type of subtlety required for film acting, even in a musical role with as much comedy as drama. Still, Erivo and Grande have chemistry in abundance and make for a memorable duo.","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),USA Today,75,Brian Truitt,"As one might say in Oz, “Wicked” is thrillifying in its melodiousness even if overlongical and ponderrific.","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),Entertainment Weekly,75,Christian Holub,"For now, like Denis Villeneuve’s first Dune, this Wicked manages to end on a note of “to be continued” while still feeling like a complete story. If only its imagery had a little more magic!","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),LarsenOnFilm,75,Josh Larsen,"A powder keg of movie-musical performances, Wicked balloons the Broadway sensation in unnecessary ways—this is only Part I, despite the fact that it runs nearly three hours—but I hardly minded thanks to the dynamic force of its two leads.","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),RogerEbert.com,75,Christy Lemire,"The razzle-dazzle that's Jon M. Chu's bread and butter is on glorious display in ""Wicked,"" the big-screen version of the beloved Broadway musical.","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),The Associated Press,75,Jocelyn Noveck,"If people breaking into song delights rather than flummoxes you, if elaborate dance numbers in village squares and fantastical nightclubs and emerald-hued cities make perfect sense to you, and especially if you already love “Wicked,” well then, you will likely love this film. If it feels like they made the best “Wicked” movie money could buy — well, it’s because they kinda did.","Nov 20, 2024"
Wicked (2024),Rolling Stone,70,David Fear,"Fans have been patiently waiting for the screen version of Wicked for decades now, and it’s safe to say that their faith will be rewarded. It’s also obvious that as much as this is still a tale of two witches, each blessed with equally beautiful voices, there’s a very clear standout here that’s lifting this occasionally leaden jazz-hands-extravaganza up to higher ground.","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),Los Angeles Times,70,Katie Walsh,"The film may struggle to take flight, but when it does, it is undeniably moving, with a message of freedom and defiance that resonates now more than ever.","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),ScreenCrush,70,Matt Singer,"All of Wicked’s best moments are still the ones from the stage. There are a lot of those great moments, though; certainly more than I expected. When Erivo’s Elphaba hits the soaring high notes in Wicked’s signature song, “Defying Gravity,” it’s enough to make you wish the wait for the second half of the film was only 15 minutes, instead of an entire year.","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),The New York Times,70,Manohla Dargis,"Despite its bumps, the movie is consistently amusing simply because it is “The Wizard of Oz” and it’s fun watching colorful, off-kilter characters singing, dancing and sometimes flying through the air (without a superhero suit).","Nov 21, 2024"
Wicked (2024),IndieWire,67,Kate Erbland,"Musicals are meant to be big, expansive, overstuffed, emotionally rich, so consuming that the concept of singing and dancing about it make all the sense in the world. Just as “Wicked” starts hitting its highest notes, it’s over. For now. For another year. And not for good.","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),The A.V. Club,67,Jesse Hassenger,"Wicked makes the old Wizard Of Oz look even more like a vivid original, while the newer movie unfolding in front of us looks like a faded memory.","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),Slant Magazine,63,Dan Rubins,Wicked’s frequent patches of sluggishness are particularly frustrating because so much of the film—especially the songs—is glorious.,"Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),New York Post,63,Johnny Oleksinski,"Even after nearly three hours of sitting, I didn’t feel as though I’d gotten to know the characters very well.","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),Boston Globe,63,Odie Henderson,"The biggest problem I had with this visually unappealing cinematic version of “Wicked,” is that it can’t handle the tonal shifts.","Nov 19, 2024"
Wicked (2024),ReelViews,63,James Berardinelli,"The movie drags at times, evidence that the too-generous 160-minute running time adversely affects pacing without resulting in a better-defined, deeper storyline.","Nov 21, 2024"
Wicked (2024),BBC,60,Nicholas Barber,"As it is, I have a strong suspicion that Wicked will work much better as the first part of a double bill, with Wicked Part 2 being shown after an interval. But we'll have to wait another year to know for sure.","Nov 19, 2024"
A Real Pain (2024),The Hollywood Reporter,100,David Rooney,"With A Real Pain, [Eisenberg] demonstrates impeccable judgment and great skill at balancing sardonic wit with piercing solemnity in a movie full of feeling, in which no emotion is unearned.","Jan 21, 2024"

A Real Pain (2024),Observer,100,Oliver Jones,"Admittedly, A Real Pain is an acquired taste; like a top-flight IPA, it is at once overly aggressive and serenely balanced.","Oct 30, 2024"
A Real Pain (2024),The New York Times,100,Manohla Dargis,"A Real Pain is a fluidly blended amalgam of pleasing, approachable subgenres, including an odd-couple buddy flick, a consciousness-raising road movie and a charged family melodrama.","Oct 31, 2024"

A Real Pain (2024),Entertainment Weekly,83,Devan Coggan,"A film that grapples with the legacy of the Holocaust doesn’t exactly make for automatic comedy, but Eisenberg deftly juggles the film’s shifting tones, evoking real laughs in some scenes while maintaining a somber respect in others.","Jan 22, 2024"
A Real Pain (2024),The Film Stage,83,Dan Mecca,"That Culkin has both the charm and bite to carry it is superb, and there’s a bravery to the open-endedness Eisenberg permits. It’s clearly a personal endeavor and clear point of growth as a filmmaker.","Jan 22, 2024"
A Real Pain (2024),Original-Cin,83,Karen Gordon,"Superficially, it plays like an indie buddy comedy. But this film walks lightly and comes at its subject matter so obliquely, that it never aims to overwhelm the viewer.  It’s about a multitude of deep emotional things, including grief, intergenerational trauma, and the complexities of love.","Nov 6, 2024"
A Real Pain (2024),Total Film,80,Jordan Farley,"While the film occasionally pushes you to feel as deeply as Benji, something it can’t quite pull off, there is a profundity to David and Benji’s pilgrimage that leaves an unmistakable impression.","Jan 25, 2024"
A Real Pain (2024),New York Magazine (Vulture),80,Bilge Ebiri,The picture’s charming modesty is its great virtue; it’s a light movie with a heavy heart.,"Jan 26, 2024"
A Real Pain (2024),Time Out,80,Phil de Semlyen,"Culkin, just as motor-mouthed and f-bombing as Succession’s Roman Roy, but here with an extra slug of despair, is the manic yin to Eisenberg’s neurotic but compassionate yang. It’s an inspired on-screen pairing that plays to both actor’s strengths and finds space for melancholy amid some deeply awkward laughs.","Jan 29, 2024"
A Real Pain (2024),The Telegraph,80,Tim Robey,"A Real Pain is a very welcome throwback to a type of indie comedy-drama that had all but disappeared. It manages to be ruefully perceptive and laugh-out-loud funny, often at the same time: that’s not easy. It also presents characters with issues we grow to understand, and doesn’t set about artificially “fixing” them: how refreshing.","Oct 16, 2024"
A Real Pain (2024),IGN,80,Lex Briscuso,A Real Pain is a hilarious and tender drama that shows us that truly living is the only way to honor those we've lost.,"Oct 25, 2024"
A Real Pain (2024),Christian Science Monitor,80,Peter Rainer,A lot of emotional weight is packed into this seriocomic ramble if you know where to look.,"Nov 1, 2024"
A Real Pain (2024),Austin Chronicle,78,Kimberley Jones,"These characters have become so dear; I longed for something more climactic, more cathartic for them. Still, for the time we have with them, they make terrific company.","Nov 14, 2024"
A Real Pain (2024),IndieWire,75,Siddhant Adlakha,"Make no mistake: Culkin is the movie’s heart and soul as the eccentric, unpredictable wanderer Benji, but “A Real Pain” is — at the risk of it being too early in the filmmaker’s career to coin this term — Eisenbergian through and through.","Jan 21, 2024"
A Real Pain (2024),The Associated Press,75,Jocelyn Noveck,"It’s quite a journey for one film. All credit to Eisenberg, and his superb co-star, for making the road trip so thought-provoking.","Oct 30, 2024"
A Real Pain (2024),Chicago Sun-Times,75,Richard Roeper,"This is a smart and accomplished work with a quick wit, a palpable sense of melancholy and genuine heart.","Nov 13, 2024"
A Real Pain (2024),ReelViews,75,James Berardinelli,"A Real Pain will resonate most strongly with movie-goers who don’t mind films in which conflict is internalized and where human interaction – simple, vivid, and unforced – takes center stage.","Nov 14, 2024"
A Real Pain (2024),Movie Nation,75,Roger Moore,"It’s a funny film, but never actually hilarious. It has its touching scenes, its mild jolts of surprise.","Nov 18, 2024"
A Real Pain (2024),Polygon,73,Austen Goslin,"A Real Pain isn’t a movie about real conclusions or grand statements, but one about deeply personal relationships and how pain and history can affect them. In that way, it’s powerful, as well as deeply funny and touching.","Jan 29, 2024"
A Real Pain (2024),Paste Magazine,70,Jim Vorel,"It’s to the film’s credit that its writer-director resists pretty much every one of those conventional impulses, steering his breezy but meandering story in unexpected directions, letting it simply develop into a character portrait of two emotionally polarized individuals.","Nov 12, 2024"
A Real Pain (2024),The A.V. Club,67,Brianna Zigler,"There is no simple catharsis to reckoning the horrors of the past with the eases of the present day; all you can do is choose how to live with it, and Eisenberg’s refusal to wrap his film in a neat little bow elevates his sophomore film into something almost as difficult as its subject material.","Oct 3, 2024"
A Real Pain (2024),The Guardian,60,Adrian Horton,"A Real Pain is occasionally insightful on the subject of suffering, sometimes funny, a bit endearing, a little pretentious, often dry.","Jan 21, 2024"
A Real Pain (2024),Screen Rant,60,Mae Abdulbaki,"With personal and generational trauma at the forefront of the story, Eisenberg delivers a heartwarming film that strengthens family ties and underscores the difficulty in speaking about the pain between its members, no matter how close they used to be.","Feb 2, 2024"
A Real Pain (2024),The New Yorker,60,Richard Brody,"It’s a strange movie—far better as a concept than as a drama, though the concept is strong enough to provide a sense of inner experience, making up for what the outer, onscreen experience lacks.","Nov 5, 2024"
A Real Pain (2024),Wall Street Journal,30,Kyle Smith,"It’s thin and flat, the opposite of inventive, surprising, daring or insightful. Though it’s billed as a comedy-drama, nothing in it generates laughs, even of the cringe variety.","Nov 1, 2024"
