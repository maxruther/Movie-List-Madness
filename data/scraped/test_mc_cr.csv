I’m Still Here,2024,The New York Times,100,Alissa Wilkinson,"I’m Still Here does not present as a simple polemic about a historical and political situation, and that’s the secret to its global appeal. It’s also a moving portrait of how politics disrupts and reshapes the domestic sphere, and how solidarity, community and love are the only viable path toward living in tragedy. And it warns us to mistrust anyone who tries to erase or rewrite the past.","Jan 16, 2025"
I’m Still Here,2024,RogerEbert.com,100,Robert Daniels,"It’s difficult to fully contextualize how incredible Torres is here; she matches the film’s silent grief by keenly deploying her character’s internal angst into her slender frame. Through her formidable presence, the deliberate “I’m Still Here,” a film that locates further meaning in the face of Brazil’s present Far-Right wave, remains in the heart long after the picture fades.","Jan 16, 2025"

I’m Still Here,2024,Washington Post,100,Ty Burr,Walter Salles’s “I’m Still Here” is an epic within an epic: a teeming family drama contained within the melodrama of a country going insane.,"Jan 23, 2025"
I’m Still Here,2024,Original-Cin,100,Liam Lacey,"In I’m Still Here, Walter Salles’ first feature film in a dozen years, the Brazilian director manages an impressive feat of teleporting, placing the viewer inside the cheerful chaos of a large Brazilian family.","Jan 30, 2025"

I’m Still Here,2024,The Seattle Times,100,Moira Macdonald,"This mesmerizing film is a tribute to an astonishing woman and a timely reminder of a dark period in a country’s history.

I’m Still Here,2024,The Observer (UK),100,Wendy Ide,"The realisation that her husband is gone for good is a gradual process that plays out, largely without words, on Torres’s face, in a performance of extraordinary intelligence and emotional complexity.","Feb 26, 2025"
I’m Still Here,2024,The A.V. Club,91,Manuel Betancourt,"Heartrending yet never maudlin, I’m Still Here is a humanist drama that, in shining a light on insidious injustice, becomes a balm to warn and warm its audiences in equal measure.","Jan 14, 2025"

I’m Still Here,2024,Collider,90,Emma Kiely,"The chemistry between all of the Paira family members forms the beating heart of the film, devastating the audience by reminding them how happy they used to be, but promising them that nothing can shatter their sense of spirit, because they are together.","Oct 15, 2024"

I’m Still Here,2024,Chicago Tribune,88,Michael Phillips,"Torres is one of those screen veterans with a surgically precise relationship to the camera, never pushing, always searching for emotions expressed even as they’re being hidden, or held in check, because someone’s watching.","Jan 27, 2025"

I’m Still Here,2024,Boston Globe,88,Odie Henderson,"Director Walter Salles returns to the political filmmaking he employed in the 2004 Che Guevara film, “The Motorcycle Diaries.” Like that film, this one follows a protagonist who becomes an activist after being jarred by political events.","Jan 30, 2025"

I’m Still Here,2024,Rolling Stone,80,David Fear,"What’s remarkable is how [Torres] never overplays anything, or goes for easy histrionics and rending of garments even when the movie itself becomes heavy-handed in the back half.","Jan 17, 2025"
I’m Still Here,2024,TheWrap,80,Chase Hutchinson,"As Salles shows us, such a seismic loss spans many generations just as it does entire histories that are still being written. We must then always remember the people, their individual stories, and what it was that they endured so that others may never have to do so again.","Jan 21, 2025"

I’m Still Here,2024,IndieWire,75,Leila Latif,"The idea of them getting justice never feels on the table, but the film instead is a path out of the madness of a system where to simply have what happened to their father admitted would fill some of the void he has left behind.","Sep 2, 2024"

I’m Still Here,2024,The New Yorker,70,Justin Chang,"It was shrewd of the screenwriters, Murilo Hauser and Heitor Lorega, to stick so closely to Eunice’s perspective, trusting the audience to identify with her uncertainty, her vulnerability, and her instinctive urge to protect her children.

I’m Still Here,2024,Empire,60,Gavia Baker-Whitelaw,"This drama is a little too sedate to make its mark, but director Walter Salles delivers a sensitive portrait of Eunice Paiva's family life during a period of traumatic upheaval.","Feb 19, 2025"
I’m Still Here,2024,The Playlist,58,Marshall Shaffer,"Given the unhurried pacing and general underplaying of the situation’s gravity, the film feels like visiting a museum exhibit rather than living through a flashpoint of history. Here, the past’s horrors are but pictures nestled safely behind glass.","Sep 2, 2024"
I’m Still Here,2024,The Film Stage,50,Savina Petkova,"On this occasion Salles has somehow failed to find the right cinematic framework for this biopic storytelling. The film feels uncalibrated, but not in the free-flowing, depth-exploring, liberated kind of way.","Sep 2, 2024"
I’m Still Here,2024,Slant Magazine,50,Cole Kronman,"The film has trouble excavating any coarse humanism from this decidedly human story, opting instead to paint the family at its center in broad, uninspired strokes.","Oct 9, 2024"
Nickel Boys,2024,The Hollywood Reporter,100,Lovia Gyarkye,"Ross, honoring the perspective shift that characterizes Whitehead’s novel, switches between Elwood and Turner’s points of view, remaining, at all times, in the subjective mode. The commitment to this way of storytelling imbues Nickel Boy with an overwhelming intimacy and becomes another way that Ross, as a filmmaker, stretches what it means to represent Black people.","Sep 1, 2024"
Nickel Boys,2024,IndieWire,100,David Ehrlich,"Pure sense and subjectivity in a way that evokes the same visual magic of Ross’ documentary work, Nickel Boys so viscerally and fundamentally centers the experience of its young Black characters that even the most racist brand of revisionist history could never hope to deny their truth.","Sep 1, 2024"
Nickel Boys,2024,Screen Daily,100,Fionnuala Halligan,"Nickel Boys is about societal evil, certainly, and carries a score which almost bites the skin of the audience as a reminder of that pain, but it is the tenderness at its core that deals the emotional blow.","Sep 27, 2024"

Nickel Boys,2024,The Film Stage,100,Jourdain Searles,"It feels alive like an open, bleeding heart. It’s a tragic story told with hope that doesn’t ring saccharine or overwrought. Sometimes it moves like water, flowing from ugliness to beauty. There are few American films that come close to what it accomplishes, as either film or adaptation. Nickel Boys suggests a miracle, with the makings of a classic.","Oct 9, 2024"
Nickel Boys,2024,Observer,100,Oliver Jones,"It’s a movie that is not only worth returning to again and again, but one you will be grateful to have walking alongside you for years to come.","Dec 11, 2024"
Nickel Boys,2024,The New York Times,100,Manohla Dargis,"Part of what makes Nickel Boys striking is how Ross stays true to the novel but with his own voice, his own narrative and visual style, and how he uses moments in time and freighted images — faces, hands, flashing police lights, an alligator in a class, a mule in a hall — to build the story.","Dec 12, 2024"
Nickel Boys,2024,The Associated Press,100,Lindsey Bahr,"The threads do come together, but it requires a bit of patience and giving yourself over to the film, which is both formally and emotionally eye-opening. Adapting great literature can sometimes send filmmakers running towards the conventional; Thank goodness Ross charted his own path instead.","Dec 12, 2024"
Nickel Boys,2024,Rolling Stone,100,David Fear,What the filmmaker and his collaborators have given us is something truly special: a radical work of art that channels a tsunami of radical empathy. And it couldn’t feel more necessary or vital at this moment in time.,"Dec 12, 2024"
Nickel Boys,2024,Slashfilm,100,Chris Evangelista,"For all its heartbreak, for all its pain, Nickel Boys is a staggeringly beautiful film. You don't simply watch it; you experience it. This is a major work of art, and we are lucky to have it.","Dec 12, 2024"
Nickel Boys,2024,Time Out,100,Sophie Monks Kaufman,"This is Ross’s first fiction feature and its power comes as no surprise to those familiar with his 2018 calling card of a documentary. Hale County, This Morning This Evening announced a gifted photographer driven by sensitivity to his subjects’ dignity. Accordingly, Nickel Boys miraculously goes against the grain of the story’s devastating trajectory by leading with the same loving eye.","Dec 13, 2024"

Nickel Boys,2024,The Seattle Times,100,Moira Macdonald,"Nickel Boys is a life, made up of pieces; some of them lovely, some devastating. It’s a mesmerizing, uniquely told story — of memory, of injustice, of friendship, of survival.","Jan 14, 2025"
Nickel Boys,2024,Entertainment Weekly,91,Maureen Lee Lenker,"Nickel Boys is a fragmented film, so much so that it can be difficult to grasp it. But at a certain point, it turns around and grabs you instead, refusing to let go until you're left sitting in a startling and stunned silence.","Sep 4, 2024"
Nickel Boys,2024,Original-Cin,91,Liam Lacey,"Anyone looking for an uplifting story in the mode of Spotlight or Erin Brockovich won’t find gratification in Ross’s sombre film. Nickel Boys, a film that impresses and occasionally perplexes, is not a story of delayed justice achieved, or the suffering of others appreciated from a safe historical distance.","Jan 13, 2025"
Nickel Boys,2024,Vanity Fair,90,Richard Lawson,"Nickel Boys is perhaps a rebuke to the idea that violence must be plainly stated in order to be understood. Here, it is palpably present in every negative space. What Ross instead affords these young men is the dignity of a point of view, drawing the viewer into the bracing immediacy of mind and body.","Sep 27, 2024"
Nickel Boys,2024,Collider,90,Ross Bonaime,"Ross has found an overwhelmingly perfect way to bring Whitehead’s story to the screen, one that feels like a step forward for how cinematic stories can be told. It’s beautiful, heart-wrenching, and refreshing in equal measure. Now, Nickel Boys is a masterpiece in two different formats.","Nov 26, 2024"
Nickel Boys,2024,The New Yorker,90,Richard Brody,"In a year of audaciously accomplished movies, “Nickel Boys” stands out as different in kind. Ross, who co-wrote the script with Joslyn Barnes, achieves an advance in narrative form, one that singularly befits the movie’s subject—not just dramatically but historically and morally, too.","Dec 6, 2024"
Nickel Boys,2024,Arizona Republic,90,Dina Kaur,"With a brilliant twist at the end, “Nickel Boys” is a masterpiece of an adaptation that showcases the harsh realities of racism within American society.","Dec 10, 2024"
Nickel Boys,2024,ABC News,90,Peter Travers,Creative artistry radiates from every frame of this groundbreaking film from director RaMell Ross who joins with camera wiz Jomo Fray to take us inside the eyes of two young Black men (Ethan Herisse and Brandon Wilson) to expose the abuses in a Florida reform school,"Dec 13, 2024"

Nickel Boys,2024,New Orleans Times-Picayune,88,Mike Scott,"The sheer depth of emotion at work in “Nickel Boys” — the palpable anguish, the infuriating injustice, the heartrending loss — more than compensates for any perceived stylistic flaws.","Jan 13, 2025"
Nickel Boys,2024,Movie Nation,88,Roger Moore,"Nickel Boys is American history, Southern history and Florida history uncovered and exposed, and a cautionary lesson to a culture backsliding into the comfort of more and more lies and delusions, all served up in one of the most artful films of 2024.","Jan 19, 2025"
Nickel Boys,2024,Paste Magazine,84,Jesse Hassenger,"Though Nickel Boys is at least in part about Black oppression and the suffering that comes along with it, Ross uses the movie’s point of view to avoid making a movie that turns that suffering into a marquee attraction or an endurance test.","Oct 9, 2024"
Nickel Boys,2024,The A.V. Club,83,Tomris Laffly,"Ross’ formal dedication sometimes stands in the way of story and emotion, prioritizing visuals over earned moments of expressive, swelling feelings. And so this critic did wonder if Nickel Boys should have dialed up its narrative ambitions from time to time, stepping just a bit away from its creative non-fiction temperaments.","Sep 1, 2024"
Nickel Boys,2024,The Telegraph,80,Tim Robey,"Rightly treating the book as a new American classic, Ross doesn’t try to supplant it so much as do the best possible job of illustrating it: a deference to the source that makes his film a modest triumph.","Oct 16, 2024"

Nickel Boys,2024,The Globe and Mail (Toronto),80,Aparita Bhandari,"It’s hard to describe Nickel Boys. It seems like an injustice to call it, simply, a film.

Nickel Boys,2024,NME,80,Hollie Geraghty,"While the narrative never quite makes peace in the way you would expect and does meander slightly off course, it seems Ross had no intention of a textbook crescendo.","Feb 28, 2025"
Nickel Boys,2024,Austin Chronicle,78,Richard Whittaker,"If anything, Ross’ work reminds us that the camera need not be God’s unblinking eye on a story. He has crafted an exceptional film driven by captivating performances.","Jan 9, 2025"
Nickel Boys,2024,ReelViews,75,James Berardinelli,"Nickel Boys has a lot to recommend it, but there’s a sense that the experience could have been more devastating had the filmmakers simply let it play out rather than using it as an opportunity for directorial flourishes and experimentation.","Dec 12, 2024"

Nickel Boys,2024,Variety,60,Peter Debruge,"For the first hour or so, Nickel Boys feels like the most exciting narrative debut since “Beasts of the Southern Wild.” Then Ross tries something bold that doesn’t quite work, and the experiment collapses upon itself.","Sep 2, 2024"

The Apprentice,2024,Chicago Sun-Times,88,Richard Roeper,"Most impressive of all are the performances by Sebastian Stan as the raw and ambitious younger Trump, and Jeremy Strong (the “eldest boy” from “Succession”) as the unconscionable Cohn.

The Brutalist,2024,The Independent,100,Clarisse Loughrey,"It’s not a film to devour, but to be devoured by. There’s such a weight to it that it creates its own field of gravity.","Jan 27, 2025"
The Brutalist,2024,NME,100,Paul Bradshaw,"A three hour and thirty minute biopic about art, history, money, sex, trauma and concrete, it’s heavyweight in every sense: a monument to its own greatness that stands a good distance from anything else you’re likely to see at the cinema this year.","Jan 27, 2025"
The Brutalist,2024,The Globe and Mail (Toronto),95,Barry Hertz,"The Brutalist is a movie of big ideas constructed inside the transformative majesty of epic-scaled cinema. You can try to describe it, but nothing can match the power of simply opening your eyes.","Dec 19, 2024"
The Brutalist,2024,The Hollywood Reporter,90,David Rooney,"The Brutalist is a massive film in every sense, closing with a resonant epilogue that illustrates how art and beauty reach out from the past, transcending space and time to reveal a freedom of thought and identity often denied its makers.","Sep 1, 2024"
The Brutalist,2024,Paste Magazine,90,Luke Hicks,"For every beat of affecting brutalism, there is an equally affecting beat of brutality.","Sep 30, 2024"
The Brutalist,2024,Los Angeles Times,90,Amy Nicholson,"The Brutalist argues, and proves by its very existence, that the maddening thing about major works of art is that they demand invention and resources and cooperation.","Dec 18, 2024"
The Brutalist,2024,The Daily Beast,90,Nick Schager,"A harrowing 215-minute epic of perseverance, trauma, exploitation, and anti-Semitism, it’s a bracing examination of the scars of war, the difficulty of recovery, and the genius, madness, and self-destruction begat by calamity.","Dec 18, 2024"
The Brutalist,2024,IGN,90,Chase Hutchinson,"Like the imposing, unadorned structures of brutalism (think: Boston City Hall, the blocky public housing of the Soviet Union, modern additions to any university campus), it can feel at times intentionally ugly or rudimentary. But it’s also a breathtaking work that’s simultaneously maximalist and minimalist – a searing movie that’s poetic on a formal, storytelling, and thematic level.","Dec 19, 2024"
The Brutalist,2024,The New York Times,90,Manohla Dargis,"Many movies offer up a slice of reality; true to the architectural aesthetic that its title invokes, this one offers a slab.","Dec 20, 2024"
The Brutalist,2024,Slate,90,Dana Stevens,"The magisterial (yet also often funny) performances from virtually every member of the cast, the rigor which with it explores complex characters and ideas, and the sheer painterly beauty of its compositions make this one of the few movies this year I almost immediately went back to see for a second time.","Jan 14, 2025"
The Brutalist,2024,Slant Magazine,88,Marshall Shaffer,Brady Corbet builds on celluloid what Adrien Brody’s László Toth does with concrete: an unvarnished monument to the authentic American character.,"Sep 24, 2024"
The Brutalist,2024,The Associated Press,88,Jocelyn Noveck,"Though not for everyone, it’s a film that can justifiably be described as “epic” in ambition and design. And, wouldn’t you know, ambition and design are precisely what the movie’s about.","Dec 18, 2024"
The Brutalist,2024,Chicago Tribune,88,Michael Phillips,"The Brutalist is many things: some blunt, others loose and dangling, still others richly provocative, most of them remarkable.","Jan 9, 2025"
The Brutalist,2024,Movie Nation,88,Roger Moore,"You’d be hard-pressed to think of a motion picture parable that more perfectly fits its moment and the mood of the country and the world it premiered into. Corbet has tapped into the zeitgeist as well as The American Myth and made a movie that makes you wince because he, like László Tóth, refused to sentimentalize it or avert his eyes from the ugliness.","Jan 19, 2025"
The Brutalist,2024,TheWrap,85,Ben Croll,"Taken as a whole, The Brutalist both mourns and celebrates American ambition –the ambitions of an immigrant class trying for a new life with no guarantee of success, and the ambitions of a filmmaker filling a canvas with a lifetime of obsessions.","Sep 4, 2024"
The Brutalist,2024,The Atlantic,85,David Sims,"The highest compliment I can bestow on it is that Corbet’s drive has paid dividends, leaving much for me to puzzle through.","Jan 10, 2025"
The Brutalist,2024,IndieWire,83,David Ehrlich,Corbet and Fastvold’s script is left to engineer a reductive non-climax that illustrates the relationship between capitalist and laborer in the most obvious terms imaginable.,"Sep 1, 2024"
The Brutalist,2024,Variety,80,Owen Gleiberman,"It’s clear that Corbet made this movie because he wants it to mean something big. Whether it does may be in the eye of the beholder. Mostly, The Brutalist lets you feel that you’re seeing a man’s life pass before your eyes. That may be meaning enough.","Sep 1, 2024"
The Brutalist,2024,Time,80,Stephanie Zacharek,"The Brutalist is a kind of crazy space church, designed specifically for the communal moviegoing experience. It's a place to gather and give thanks.","Sep 3, 2024"
The Brutalist,2024,Collider,80,Ross Bonaime,"Despite its occasional flaws, The Brutalist is one of the most remarkable films of the year, and proof that Corbet is a fascinating filmmaker to keep an eye on.","Sep 17, 2024"
The Brutalist,2024,The Observer (UK),80,Wendy Ide,"The screenplay dwells obsessively on certain aspects and rushes blithely past others. The craft of the film-making, though, is exemplary.","Jan 27, 2025"
The Brutalist,2024,The A.V. Club,75,Brianna Zigler,"The Brutalist is operating in the shadow of a tradition of cinematic epics, there is an expected journey the film has the opportunity to stray from, and it doesn’t nearly enough.","Oct 3, 2024"
