Art for Everybody,2025,Miranda Yousef,The New York Times,90,Alissa Wilkinson,"Art for Everybody — which is well structured, meticulously researched and revealing, even for a Kinkade-jaded viewer like me — manages to complicate the narrative, thanks in part to sensitive interviews with family and friends, including his wife, Nanette, and their four daughters.","Mar 28, 2025"
Art for Everybody,2025,Miranda Yousef,RogerEbert.com,88,Matt Zoller Seitz,"This is a thoroughly fascinating documentary about a family discovering the depth and complexity of their patriarch while coming to terms with his flaws, as well as the capitalist system of art exhibition and sale that has different tiers and gatekeepers, depending on who you are and your version of life.","Mar 28, 2025"
Art for Everybody,2025,Miranda Yousef,Film Threat,80,Josiah Teal,So much of Art for Everybody follows a traditional rise-to-power and fall-from-grace structure. The story gives equal time to Kinkade’s adoring friends and his harshest critics while allowing his family to serve as both. Yousef never tries to immortalize or romanticize the painter but instead focuses on the person and his path to the limelight.,"May 2, 2023"
The Friend,2025,"David Siegel, Scott McGehee",RogerEbert.com,100,Glenn Kenny,"The work Watts and Murray do in this sequence is both emotionally raw and acutely thoughtful, rife with specificity. It’s career-high stuff.","Mar 28, 2025"
The Friend,2025,"David Siegel, Scott McGehee",The New York Times,90,Sheri Linden,"This is a love story, after all, and one with a keen grasp of the mournful, curious glances between its two leads — of how much goes untranslated between them, and how much is conveyed.","Mar 27, 2025"
The Friend,2025,"David Siegel, Scott McGehee",Observer,88,Emily Zemler,"It’s self-reflexive at times, and occasionally pretentious in its high-brow approach. But writers and directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel have not only made the story accessible onscreen, they have infused it with a raw emotional life that was less easily attained in print.","Mar 24, 2025"
The Friend,2025,"David Siegel, Scott McGehee",The Daily Beast,85,Nick Schager,A compassionate portrait of mourning and the bonds that keep us united.,"Mar 26, 2025"
The Friend,2025,"David Siegel, Scott McGehee",IndieWire,83,Kate Erbland,"It’s the sort of witty, wise, and warm character study we seem to be running out of these days. And that’s just when it comes to its standout dog star, the Great Dane (emphasis on great) Bing.","Aug 31, 2024"
The Friend,2025,"David Siegel, Scott McGehee",Entertainment Weekly,83,Maureen Lee Lenker,"It gracefully captures the remarkable, singular relationship that human beings share with their pets, tapping into the poignancy and warmth that comes from such a bond.","Aug 31, 2024"

The Friend,2025,"David Siegel, Scott McGehee",New York Magazine (Vulture),80,Bilge Ebiri,"Delectably ambiguous, the film always feels on the verge of some thematic breakthrough — a crystallized metaphor, a revealing flashback, a tell-tale fictional projection — but it admirably never gets there.","Oct 10, 2024"
The Friend,2025,"David Siegel, Scott McGehee",Rolling Stone,80,David Fear,[Siegel and McGehee] get that this isn’t just a story about a woman bonding with a dog — it’s a tale of loss and sorrow that inherently knows such heavy feelings aren’t confined to a single species.,"Mar 26, 2025"
The Friend,2025,"David Siegel, Scott McGehee",ABC News,75,Peter Travers,"Naomi Watts and Bill Murray are funny, touching and vital as the most recent guardians of a 150-pound Great Dane named Apollo, but the scene-stealing pup scampers off with this slight but irresistible character study and wins a special place in your heart.","Mar 28, 2025"
The Friend,2025,"David Siegel, Scott McGehee",TheWrap,72,Steve Pond,"The Friend juggles the happy, the sad and the bittersweet while somehow managing not to lose the lightness that has kept it afloat.","Aug 31, 2024"

The Friend,2025,"David Siegel, Scott McGehee",Variety,60,Peter Debruge,A by-the-numbers crowd-pleaser with a bit more on its mind than your typical canine-centric tearjerker.,"Aug 31, 2024"
The Friend,2025,"David Siegel, Scott McGehee",Collider,60,Ross Bonaime,"The Friend's heart is in the right place, but it can't get out of its own way.","Sep 10, 2024"
The Friend,2025,"David Siegel, Scott McGehee",The Guardian,60,Adrian Horton,"It can be borderline maudlin and easily teary, though The Friend is grounded enough, and Watts sufficiently understated, to not become outright eye-rolling.","Oct 4, 2024"
The Friend,2025,"David Siegel, Scott McGehee",The Playlist,50,Gregory Ellwood,"Regrettably, any sympathy the film has mustered is diminished by at least three, maybe four, additional endings that are frustratingly superfluous. These never-ending epilogues add nothing to what has come before it and, in many ways, curtail any emotional heights the film has garnered to this point.","Sep 1, 2024"
The Friend,2025,"David Siegel, Scott McGehee",Slant Magazine,50,Marshall Shaffer,"Hardly a false note is sounded throughout The Friend, but it operates within such a limited emotional range that it drifts into monotonic plainsong.","Mar 26, 2025"
The Friend,2025,"David Siegel, Scott McGehee",Wall Street Journal,40,Zachary Barnes,Without the fizz of wit and humor the underlying emotional scenario ends up feeling flat.,"Mar 27, 2025"
Việt and Nam,2025,Truong Minh Quy,RogerEbert.com,100,Simon Abrams,Việt and Nam only initially looks like something that you might expect to find on John Waters’ Best of the Year list. Soon enough the movie becomes a gentle romance about loving the dead.,"Mar 28, 2025"
Việt and Nam,2025,Truong Minh Quy,The Hollywood Reporter,90,Lovia Gyarkye,"In exploring how the ruptures of the past map themselves onto relationships in the present, [Quy] elegantly approaches a familiar theme: how war reverberates throughout generations, imposing on witnesses and their successors.","Oct 8, 2024"
Việt and Nam,2025,Truong Minh Quy,The New York Times,90,Lisa Kennedy,Quy treats the love affair between Viet and Nam with exquisite tenderness.,"Mar 27, 2025"

Việt and Nam,2025,Truong Minh Quy,IndieWire,83,Josh Slater-Williams,"While a degree of naturalism does still make its way into many slow-burn scenes, Quy’s filmmaking largely favors expressionism.","Jun 5, 2024"
Việt and Nam,2025,Truong Minh Quy,The Film Stage,83,Luke Hicks,"Minh Quý’s slow-cinema sensibilities are nothing short of spellbinding, the trance of rumination within reason enough to seek it out. And if that’s not enough, go for the best final shot of the year: a breath-stealing beauty that will leave you frozen in your seat even after the credits are over.","Nov 1, 2024"
Việt and Nam,2025,Truong Minh Quy,Screen Daily,80,John Berra,"Viet And Nam may studiously occupy a certain world cinema niche, but Truong’s flourishes ensure that it offers a richly personal blend of the authentic and the abstract.","Jun 10, 2024"
Việt and Nam,2025,Truong Minh Quy,The Film Verdict,60,Clarence Tsui,"While the film is filled with shimmering images aplenty – including a literally sparkling trompe d’oeil – the director falls short of using the texture of his 16mm film stock to its full potential. The same could be said of his characters, who could do with more thoughtful fleshing out, while their slow-burning relationships generate more a sense of lethargy than melancholy.","Jun 10, 2024"
Secret Mall Apartment,2025,Jeremy Workman,RogerEbert.com,88,Matt Zoller Seitz,"This is a delightful, thought-provoking movie that’s about a lot of things at the same time. It’ll make you see the world with fresh eyes, and probably wonder why there isn’t more art in it.","Mar 21, 2025"
Secret Mall Apartment,2025,Jeremy Workman,Paste Magazine,74,Jim Vorel,"It’s tough to watch Secret Mall Apartment and not fall under the spell of Townsend and his earnest collaborators, possessing as they do the idealism and righteous conviction of young people in a bygone era who are quite certain that they’re going to change the world.","Mar 24, 2025"
Secret Mall Apartment,2025,Jeremy Workman,Collider,70,Luna Guthrie,There is a simplistic charm to the movie that captures the strange in-between times of the early 2000s.,"Mar 20, 2025"
Secret Mall Apartment,2025,Jeremy Workman,New York Magazine (Vulture),70,Bilge Ebiri,"These are the intriguing ideas at work in Secret Mall Apartment, but the film works as a movie thanks to the sly way it’s been put together.","Mar 21, 2025"
Secret Mall Apartment,2025,Jeremy Workman,The New York Times,70,Alissa Wilkinson,"Secret Mall Apartment makes a compelling case that the project reverberates through the lives of the artists, and maybe even the city, to this day. Art doesn’t have to be in a museum to be valuable; it doesn’t have to be own-able, repeatable or even make sense to everyone. If it changes a few lives, then it’s changed the world.","Mar 28, 2025"
