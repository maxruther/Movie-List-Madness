Art for Everybody,2025,Miranda Yousef,The New York Times,90,Alissa Wilkinson,"Art for Everybody — which is well structured, meticulously researched and revealing, even for a Kinkade-jaded viewer like me — manages to complicate the narrative, thanks in part to sensitive interviews with family and friends, including his wife, Nanette, and their four daughters.","Mar 28, 2025"
Art for Everybody,2025,Miranda Yousef,RogerEbert.com,88,Matt Zoller Seitz,"This is a thoroughly fascinating documentary about a family discovering the depth and complexity of their patriarch while coming to terms with his flaws, as well as the capitalist system of art exhibition and sale that has different tiers and gatekeepers, depending on who you are and your version of life.","Mar 28, 2025"
Art for Everybody,2025,Miranda Yousef,Film Threat,80,Josiah Teal,So much of Art for Everybody follows a traditional rise-to-power and fall-from-grace structure. The story gives equal time to Kinkade’s adoring friends and his harshest critics while allowing his family to serve as both. Yousef never tries to immortalize or romanticize the painter but instead focuses on the person and his path to the limelight.,"May 2, 2023"

The Friend,2025,"David Siegel, Scott McGehee",Observer,88,Emily Zemler,"It’s self-reflexive at times, and occasionally pretentious in its high-brow approach.

The Friend,2025,"David Siegel, Scott McGehee",New York Magazine (Vulture),80,Bilge Ebiri,"Delectably ambiguous, the film always feels on the verge of some thematic breakthrough — a crystallized metaphor, a revealing flashback, a tell-tale fictional projection — but it admirably never gets there.","Oct 10, 2024"
The Friend,2025,"David Siegel, Scott McGehee",Rolling Stone,80,David Fear,[Siegel and McGehee] get that this isn’t just a story about a woman bonding with a dog — it’s a tale of loss and sorrow that inherently knows such heavy feelings aren’t confined to a single species.,"Mar 26, 2025"
The Friend,2025,"David Siegel, Scott McGehee",ABC News,75,Peter Travers,"Naomi Watts and Bill Murray are funny, touching and vital as the most recent guardians of a 150-pound Great Dane named Apollo, but the scene-stealing pup scampers off with this slight but irresistible character study and wins a special place in your heart.","Mar 28, 2025"

Việt and Nam,2025,Truong Minh Quy,The Hollywood Reporter,90,Lovia Gyarkye,"In exploring how the ruptures of the past map themselves onto relationships in the present, [Quy] elegantly approaches a familiar theme: how war reverberates throughout generations, imposing on witnesses and their successors.","Oct 8, 2024"

Việt and Nam,2025,Truong Minh Quy,The Film Stage,83,Luke Hicks,"Minh Quý’s slow-cinema sensibilities are nothing short of spellbinding, the trance of rumination within reason enough to seek it out.

Việt and Nam,2025,Truong Minh Quy,Screen Daily,80,John Berra,"Viet And Nam may studiously occupy a certain world cinema niche, but Truong’s flourishes ensure that it offers a richly personal blend of the authentic and the abstract.","Jun 10, 2024"
Việt and Nam,2025,Truong Minh Quy,The Film Verdict,60,Clarence Tsui,"While the film is filled with shimmering images aplenty – including a literally sparkling trompe d’oeil – the director falls short of using the texture of his 16mm film stock to its full potential. The same could be said of his characters, who could do with more thoughtful fleshing out, while their slow-burning relationships generate more a sense of lethargy than melancholy.","Jun 10, 2024"
Secret Mall Apartment,2025,Jeremy Workman,RogerEbert.com,88,Matt Zoller Seitz,"This is a delightful, thought-provoking movie that’s about a lot of things at the same time. It’ll make you see the world with fresh eyes, and probably wonder why there isn’t more art in it.","Mar 21, 2025"
Secret Mall Apartment,2025,Jeremy Workman,Paste Magazine,74,Jim Vorel,"It’s tough to watch Secret Mall Apartment and not fall under the spell of Townsend and his earnest collaborators, possessing as they do the idealism and righteous conviction of young people in a bygone era who are quite certain that they’re going to change the world.","Mar 24, 2025"

Secret Mall Apartment,2025,Jeremy Workman,The New York Times,70,Alissa Wilkinson,"Secret Mall Apartment makes a compelling case that the project reverberates through the lives of the artists, and maybe even the city, to this day. Art doesn’t have to be in a museum to be valuable; it doesn’t have to be own-able, repeatable or even make sense to everyone. If it changes a few lives, then it’s changed the world.","Mar 28, 2025"

Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,The Seattle Times,100,Katie Walsh,"Black Bag may be rooted in the mind, but it is inextricably connected to the heart, especially in matters of love and trust, betrayal and murder. That’s what makes a Soderbergh genre exercise such a deliciously satisfying cinematic morsel: It is pure fun, but also deeply layered with larger existential themes, making for a delightful romantic spy drama that cannot be missed.","Mar 12, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,New York Magazine (Vulture),100,Angelica Jade Bastien,"Black Bag is a tremendous example that a film need not be making an explicit political point or obsessed with the political dimensions of its narrative to be worthwhile cinema. A work can rise to this present moment by offering us rapture. This, too, is what movies are meant to accomplish.","Mar 14, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,The New Yorker,100,Justin Chang,"Soderbergh and Koepp, for their part, express their own fervent belief: in the seductive glamour of espionage and the magnetism of Blanchett’s and Fassbender’s interlocking gazes—which is to say, in the enveloping artifice and power of movies.

Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,The Associated Press,88,Jake Coyle,"Black Bag follows a run of agilely directed thrillers by Soderbergh made with screenwriter David Koepp. They are both at the height of their almost-too-easy powers; the script, especially, is peppered with delectable dialogue.","Mar 12, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,Chicago Sun-Times,88,Richard Roeper,"I’m not going to pretend I always knew exactly what everyone was talking about as we plunged ever deeper into the weeds of double-crossing and triple-crossing among a batch of mostly iniquitous secret agents, but it’s a zippy and darkly funny ride every step of the way. The dialogue jumps off the page, and the performances are universally brilliant.","Mar 13, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,Movie Nation,88,Roger Moore,"Koepp and Soderbergh make this as much about mistrust and fidelity in a marriage as it is about spies-gone-wrong. They keep their film intimate and interrogatory, giving it an old fashioned theatrical feel.","Mar 14, 2025"

Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,ReelViews,88,James Berardinelli,"Hollywood’s decision to abandon this kind of storytelling is one reason why cinema in the 2020s has fallen into the doldrums and, when something like Black Bag arrives, it’s a bittersweet reminder of the potential of the big screen experience.","Mar 14, 2025"

Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,LarsenOnFilm,88,Josh Larsen,"Written by David Koepp, who also penned Soderbergh’s Kimi and Presence, Black Bag displays the twists and intrigue you’d expect from a top-rate spy flick, along with some scintillating dialogue.

Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,The Film Verdict,85,Alonso Duralde,"Black Bag is a not-quite-quotidian spy movie.

Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,Paste Magazine,80,Jesse Hassenger,"Without slackening its tension, Black Bag sometimes resembles a bitter comedy of manners, which are apparently also kept in the black bag for certain stretches.

Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,Time,80,Stephanie Zacharek,"Black Bag succeeds on its chilly wit, and on the cool, nervy appeal of its two stars. Blanchett strides through the movie with lioness grace; Fassbender makes George’s robotic use of logic seem like an aphrodisiac.","Mar 6, 2025"

Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,Empire,80,John Nugent,"Its pleasures lie in the dialogue, the twists, the reveals.

Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,IndieWire,75,David Ehrlich,"If Black Bag denies us the kind of duplicitous confrontations that other versions of this story might take pains to savor, Soderbergh’s aversion to giving audiences what they want — and the severe angularity that he tends to offer us now instead — is almost as rewarding here as it was utterly indefensible in “Magic Mike’s Last Dance.”","Mar 12, 2025"

On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,2025,Rungano Nyoni,The New Yorker,100,Justin Chang,"It is taut, absorbing, and, at ninety-nine minutes, ruthlessly concise.

On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,2025,Rungano Nyoni,The Film Stage,91,Michael Frank,"The writer-director never rushes this story, but still wastes no time in the film––each scene contains weight and value.

On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,2025,Rungano Nyoni,The Hollywood Reporter,90,Lovia Gyarkye,"Perhaps what’s most impressive about On Becoming a Guinea Fowl is Nyoni’s respect for subtext. Her film doesn’t aim to be a guide, a balm or an ode to forgiveness. The director rejects the ease of over-explanation and allure of an exclusively reverential tone. She reaches for honesty, and what she uncovers is at once disquieting and deeply absorbing.","May 18, 2024"
On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,2025,Rungano Nyoni,Variety,90,Guy Lodge,"Blending molasses-dark comedy with searing poetic realism to capture contemporary Zambian society at a generational impasse between staunch tradition and social progress, this is palpably new, future-minded filmmaking, at once intrepidly daring and rigorously poised.","May 18, 2024"
On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,2025,Rungano Nyoni,New York Magazine (Vulture),90,Bilge Ebiri,"The off-kilter, absurdist vibe of the picture is enchanting, but it’s rooted in deep horror: The whole movie is about the ways that cruelty and injustice become codified.

Heart Eyes,2025,Josh Ruben,USA Today,75,Brian Truitt,"Heart Eyes is tastier than a box of candy hearts, unleashes some highly entertaining kills and sticks mostly to its genre scripts. But if it drags even one horror-hating significant other over to the dark side, that’s a bloody win.","Feb 6, 2025"
Heart Eyes,2025,Josh Ruben,Paste Magazine,73,Jesse Hassenger,"Heart Eyes can’t help but swoon at the rich tradition of slashers serving as first-date fodder. It’s not especially scary, but it’s a thrill all the same.","Feb 10, 2025"
Heart Eyes,2025,Josh Ruben,Collider,70,Aidan Kelley,"The two leads are so charming, the jokes are genuinely funny, and the kills are delightfully gorey.","Jan 31, 2025"
Heart Eyes,2025,Josh Ruben,Slant Magazine,63,Justin Clark,"Heart Eyes is a slasher movie first, and a gnarly one at that, with some imaginative, seat-shiftingly gruesome kills, and some particularly ominous set pieces.","Feb 1, 2025"
Heart Eyes,2025,Josh Ruben,The Seattle Times,63,Mark Meszoros,"Overall, Heart Eyes has a winning formula, but maybe don’t expect it to sweep you off your feet.","Feb 5, 2025"
Heart Eyes,2025,Josh Ruben,Observer,63,Dylan Roth,"It’s both a pretty good post-Kevin Williamson slasher movie and a pretty good post-Nora Ephron studio romcom. The finished recipe isn’t much more than the sum of its ingredients, but when one of those ingredients is in such short supply, the result is some welcome — if blood-splattered — comfort food.","Feb 7, 2025"
Heart Eyes,2025,Josh Ruben,IGN,60,A.A. Dowd,From the sincerity of the lead performances to the cartoonish gore offered by Werewolves Within director Josh Rubenn. There are much worse ways to spend Valentine’s Day than a genre cocktail for saps and gorehounds alike.,"Jan 31, 2025"
Heart Eyes,2025,Josh Ruben,Slashfilm,60,Chris Evangelista,"Heart Eyes is solid enough to entertain. The jokes land, the leads are great, and the romance storyline is surprisingly sweet.","Jan 31, 2025"
Heart Eyes,2025,Josh Ruben,The Hollywood Reporter,60,Frank Scheck,"The creatives’ obvious affinity for the genre comes through in every frame of the film, and to their credit Heart Eyes includes many clever touches.","Jan 31, 2025"
Heart Eyes,2025,Josh Ruben,Los Angeles Times,60,Amy Nicholson,"A Valentine’s Day massacre in which PDA leads to public executions, it’s got decent gags, middling scares and a rationale sloppier than two dogs sharing a strand of spaghetti. As date night fare, it’ll do.","Feb 5, 2025"
Heart Eyes,2025,Josh Ruben,ABC News,60,Peter Travers,"For all its imperfections and borrowed horror inspirations, this cheeky romcom scarefest is still one movie Valentine that delivers the goods for shudders and cuddles.","Feb 7, 2025"
Heart Eyes,2025,Josh Ruben,New York Magazine (Vulture),60,Alison Willmore,Heart Eyes is strong enough that the shortcomings that keep it in the realm of the passable instead of the actually good are maddening.,"Feb 7, 2025"
Heart Eyes,2025,Josh Ruben,The Observer (UK),60,Wendy Ide,"It’s all fairly predictable. Anyone who has seen more than a couple of serial killer movies will have no problem assembling a list of possible masked murderers. But Josh Ruben’s film goes above and beyond when it comes to squelchy, visceral gore.","Feb 19, 2025"
Heart Eyes,2025,Josh Ruben,The A.V. Club,58,Katie Rife,"Even when its characters do get earnest, Heart Eyes has its tongue so far in its cheek that these moments of vulnerability are also viewed from an ironic distance. Instead of feeling for these characters, we’re waiting for the bloody punchline—which will come, and will be funny in a deliciously morbid kind of way. There’s nothing to hold on to, and certainly nothing to be afraid of.","Feb 5, 2025"
Heart Eyes,2025,Josh Ruben,Screen Rant,50,Molly Freeman,"All in all, Heart Eyes is a fine horror movie. It has a fun and unique idea, and the first act of the movie is very strong, but Heart Eyes loses its way and culminates in a middling-to-bad third act that squanders all the potential of the premise and beginning.","Jan 31, 2025"
Heart Eyes,2025,Josh Ruben,The Daily Beast,50,Nick Schager,"[A] bland stab at genre hybridization, whose sole accomplishment is falling flat at everything it tries.","Feb 5, 2025"
Heart Eyes,2025,Josh Ruben,The Guardian,40,Benjamin Lee,"Whatever might have made sense on paper just doesn’t translate to screen, a fun little concept that ends up being something of a drag.","Feb 7, 2025"
Heart Eyes,2025,Josh Ruben,Movie Nation,38,Roger Moore,"The goofy tone is maintained, start to finish. But that finale is the biggest dud among the various clunky set-ups that don’t produce anything funny or scary or romantic.","Feb 7, 2025"
Heart Eyes,2025,Josh Ruben,The New York Times,30,Erik Piepenburg,It’s hard to discern who the film is for when it feels as if it’s been passed around genre writing classes in search of an identity.,"Feb 6, 2025"
Heart Eyes,2025,Josh Ruben,Little White Lies,30,Billie Walker,Unfortunately Heart Eyes is so vacuous and confused that it can’t even decide if it’s cynical or sentimental about love itself.,"Feb 14, 2025"
Time Passages,2025,Kyle Henry,RogerEbert.com,88,Matt Zoller Seitz,"I haven’t seen anything quite like it before. That alone makes it worth seeing, as long as you accept the proposition that a movie like this is unique, in some ways beyond genre labels, and feeling its way towards the right flow and shape as it goes.","Feb 3, 2025"
