One to One: John & Yoko,2025,Kevin MacDonald,NME,100,Matthew Turner,"In short, this is a terrific documentary from start to finish, beautifully structured and by turns bracingly political, informative and inspiring.","Mar 31, 2025"
One to One: John & Yoko,2025,Kevin MacDonald,New York Magazine (Vulture),100,Bilge Ebiri,One to One: John & Yoko becomes not just an enormously moving historical portrait but a freshly relevant and cathartic one.,"Apr 12, 2025"
One to One: John & Yoko,2025,Kevin MacDonald,The Hollywood Reporter,90,Sheri Linden,"In its mix of remarkable archival material, the film is both tender and galvanizing, summoning up what New York felt like in 1972 (yes, I would know) and offering a fresh slant on a country’s upheaval and a generation’s countercultural awakening.","Feb 1, 2025"
One to One: John & Yoko,2025,Kevin MacDonald,Variety,90,Owen Gleiberman,The rare rock doc that’s a must-see.,"Feb 1, 2025"
One to One: John & Yoko,2025,Kevin MacDonald,The Irish Times,90,Donald Clarke,There is always room for a post-Beatles doc if it’s this good and this original.,"Apr 9, 2025"
One to One: John & Yoko,2025,Kevin MacDonald,The Film Verdict,88,Deborah Young,"It is a smart and warm-hearted documentary that never tries to separate the superstar at its center from the political and cultural context, or to split John from the woman he loved and admired — and never deliberately cast shade on. It is also one of the finest portraits of these artists on film.","Mar 31, 2025"
One to One: John & Yoko,2025,Kevin MacDonald,Washington Post,88,Ty Burr,It takes nerve to make a documentary about the most unpopular period of a massively popular public figure’s life. “One to One: John & Yoko” demonstrates that it’s worth the effort.,"Apr 10, 2025"
One to One: John & Yoko,2025,Kevin MacDonald,RogerEbert.com,88,Glenn Kenny,The movie is at its most fascinating in its depiction of Lennon as a pragmatic activist.,"Apr 11, 2025"
One to One: John & Yoko,2025,Kevin MacDonald,IndieWire,83,Vikram Murthi,"As much as the film repeatedly pays tribute to their relationship— its unaffected honesty, their political influence, the beautiful and often alienating art they created — it can’t compete with the view of their cozy apartment. “All I want is the truth,” Lennon once sang; he knew that it’s much simpler than you could ever imagine.","Feb 1, 2025"
One to One: John & Yoko,2025,Kevin MacDonald,Collider,80,Ross Bonaime,Macdonald and Rice-Edwards take us back to the 1970s to explore these two but also show that two of the most important figures in music history were just a pair of flawed individuals trying their best to use their position of power to make the world a better place.,"Feb 1, 2025"
One to One: John & Yoko,2025,Kevin MacDonald,The Guardian,80,Xan Brooks,"If only more nostalgic music documentaries could muster such a fun, fierce and full-blooded take on old, familiar material. One to One, against the odds, makes Lennon feel somehow vital again.","Feb 1, 2025"
One to One: John & Yoko,2025,Kevin MacDonald,Time Out,80,David Hughes,It’s a document of a febrile time and a wake-up call for a fizzled revolution.,"Mar 10, 2025"
One to One: John & Yoko,2025,Kevin MacDonald,The Telegraph,80,Robbie Collin,"The result is in every sense a partial portrait, but doesn’t remotely suffer from being so – in fact, its exhortation to viewers to fill in the gaps where possible is one of its central pleasures.","Apr 11, 2025"
One to One: John & Yoko,2025,Kevin MacDonald,The Guardian,80,Peter Bradshaw,"It’s a film that mixes small screen zeitgeist fragments and madeleine moments, a memory quilt of a certain time and place, juxtaposing Jerry Rubin and Allen Ginsberg with Richard Nixon and George Wallace, John and Yoko in concert with ads for Tupperware – all inspired by the fact that John and Yoko did an awful lot of TV watching in their small New York apartment of that time, with John in particular thrilled by the American novelty of 24/7 television.","Apr 11, 2025"
One to One: John & Yoko,2025,Kevin MacDonald,Screen Daily,70,Fionnuala Halligan,"While it’s a remarkable feat, particularly from an editing perspective, there’s also something laboratory-like about raiding the archive from a distance and imposing such an articficial structure on it.","Feb 1, 2025"
One to One: John & Yoko,2025,Kevin MacDonald,TheWrap,70,Steve Pond,"The filmmakers have managed to make a bracing, scattered and somewhat revelatory look at a period that’ll go down as a misstep in which the Smart Beatle was fumbling to figure out what to do and intermittently coming up with a satisfactory answer.","Mar 31, 2025"
One to One: John & Yoko,2025,Kevin MacDonald,San Francisco Chronicle,50,Bob Strauss,One to One: John & Yoko combines the best aspects of Boomer nostalgia with generational overindulgence.,"Apr 8, 2025"
One to One: John & Yoko,2025,Kevin MacDonald,Little White Lies,50,Michael Leader,"While she shares title billing, Ono is still framed in relation to her husband. And yet, even in passing, she emerges as an engaged, inscrutable and passionate artist: creatively confident where John seems adrift.","Apr 11, 2025"
One to One: John & Yoko,2025,Kevin MacDonald,The Times,40,Kevin Maher,"It is highly likely that Macdonald is making explicit connections between the US military industrial complex and the system of consumer-based capitalism that supposedly dulls the masses and funds the wars. But, sheesh, does it have to be such a drag?","Mar 31, 2025"
That They May Face the Rising Sun,2025,Pat Collins,The Irish Times,100,Tara Brady,The best Irish film in a long time.,"Mar 25, 2025"
That They May Face the Rising Sun,2025,Pat Collins,Screen Daily,90,Allan Hunter,The story of a couple finding their best life in the rural Ireland of the 1980s is beautifully realised and quietly beguiling.,"Mar 25, 2025"
That They May Face the Rising Sun,2025,Pat Collins,RogerEbert.com,88,Sheila O'Malley,"By the end of the film, you feel you know these people. You still may be a “blow-in,” but they’ve allowed you access to their inner worlds, they’ve allowed you to see them.","Apr 11, 2025"
That They May Face the Rising Sun,2025,Pat Collins,Film Threat,70,Andy Howell,"Overall, That They May Face the Rising Sun is solid and worth your time. The acting is top-notch, and the story is compelling, but its verisimilitude is truly off the charts. This is the closest you can get to a time machine to take you to a bygone time and place that is little celebrated but worth remembering.","Mar 25, 2025"
That They May Face the Rising Sun,2025,Pat Collins,The Guardian,60,Phil Hoad,"Despite its somewhat diffuse centre, Collins’ film still has a straightforward poignancy, with subtle and dignified performances across the board.","Mar 25, 2025"
