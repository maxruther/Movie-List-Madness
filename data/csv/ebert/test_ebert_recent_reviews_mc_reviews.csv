Black Bag,2025,The Seattle Times,100,Katie Walsh,"Black Bag may be rooted in the mind, but it is inextricably connected to the heart, especially in matters of love and trust, betrayal and murder. That’s what makes a Soderbergh genre exercise such a deliciously satisfying cinematic morsel: It is pure fun, but also deeply layered with larger existential themes, making for a delightful romantic spy drama that cannot be missed.","Mar 12, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,New York Magazine (Vulture),100,Angelica Jade Bastien,"Black Bag is a tremendous example that a film need not be making an explicit political point or obsessed with the political dimensions of its narrative to be worthwhile cinema.

Black Bag,2025,Empire,80,John Nugent,"Its pleasures lie in the dialogue, the twists, the reveals.

Black Bag,2025,IndieWire,75,David Ehrlich,"If Black Bag denies us the kind of duplicitous confrontations that other versions of this story might take pains to savor, Soderbergh’s aversion to giving audiences what they want — and the severe angularity that he tends to offer us now instead — is almost as rewarding here as it was utterly indefensible in “Magic Mike’s Last Dance.”","Mar 12, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,San Francisco Chronicle,75,G.

On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,2025,The Hollywood Reporter,90,Lovia Gyarkye,"Perhaps what’s most impressive about On Becoming a Guinea Fowl is Nyoni’s respect for subtext. Her film doesn’t aim to be a guide, a balm or an ode to forgiveness. The director rejects the ease of over-explanation and allure of an exclusively reverential tone. She reaches for honesty, and what she uncovers is at once disquieting and deeply absorbing.","May 18, 2024"

On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,2025,Los Angeles Times,90,Robert Abele,"In its atmosphere of gnawing discomfort with imposed secrecy about bad men, “On Becoming a Guinea Fowl” is a uniquely dimensional work of character and temporality.
