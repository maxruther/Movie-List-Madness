If Beale Street Could Talk,2018,Barry Jenkins,RogerEbert.com,100,Odie Henderson,"Not much has changed for people of color, which probably wouldn’t surprise the author.

If Beale Street Could Talk,2018,Barry Jenkins,Film Journal International,91,Wendy R. Weinstein,"It’s a perfect pairing of sensibilities; Jenkins and Baldwin share a nuanced, lyrical style that conveys the beauty and hope in even the most despairing of situations, with a focus on the emotional truths of their characters.

It’s what Blanche DuBois says in “A Streetcar Named Desire”: “I don’t want realism. I want magic!” In “Beale Street” that magic can be crushing, and soul-stirring, sometimes simultaneously.

If Beale Street Could Talk,2018,Barry Jenkins,Variety,70,Peter Debruge,"The movie quotes Baldwin as saying, “Every black person born in America was born on Beale Street,” but this one may as well be located inside a snow globe. In deciding how to translate Baldwin’s prose to the screen, Jenkins may as well have made Allen Ginsberg’s “Howl” as a Douglas Sirk movie (or put Alice Waters’ “The Color Purple” through the Steven Spielberg filter).","Sep 9, 2018"

Babygirl,2024,Halina Reijn,The A.V. Club,100,Anna McKibbin,"Reijn has crafted a feature-length homage to the early rush of attraction–one that the director knows can strike unprovoked, regardless of relationship status. Within the film’s 114-minute runtime, that ephemeral spark between Romy and Samuel is bottled, smashed, and left seeping across the screen, leaving an intriguing pattern in its wake.","Sep 12, 2024"

Babygirl,2024,Halina Reijn,The Film Verdict,95,Alonso Duralde,"Babygirl is the rare adult drama that understands that complicated characters can be likable, even if their behavior is sometimes decidedly unlikable; it addresses power and gender dynamics in ways that avoid easy, post-#metoo buzzwords; and it’s going to lead to some really interesting post-screening date-night discussions.","Aug 30, 2024"
Babygirl,2024,Halina Reijn,The Playlist,91,Rafaela Sales Ross,"This back and forth between assuredness and doubt also makes “Babygirl” a refreshing look at BDSM and questions of consent and desire. Reijn is unafraid to have her characters play out all the wobbles that come with negotiating one another’s boundaries, reinforcing how pleasure comes from good communication. That the Dutch director manages to do so while crafting some of the hottest sex scenes in a major film in years and without dropping the ball in pacing this satire on the era of the politically correct feels almost impossible.","Aug 30, 2024"
Babygirl,2024,Halina Reijn,The Film Stage,91,Savina Petkova,"There is wit, some stinging humor, and a lot of arousal baked into Babygirl, but it all works so well as an exciting, sexy (yes, let’s reclaim this word!) whole because the film pays attention to sex. The mood, the boundaries, the mistakes, the ecstasy of it all feed into its melodramatic streaks.","Aug 30, 2024"
Babygirl,2024,Halina Reijn,Screen Rant,90,Alexander Harrison,"Truly, all of Babygirl is fascinating to watch. There's such clear perspective in the filmmaking, and even though I've dwelt on Reijn's more thoughtful touches, the defining trait for many might be a wicked sense of humor. Laughter came easy and often for me and the audience I saw it with – sometimes with the characters, sometimes at them, but always with the movie. It's as if we're being reminded that, however serious the themes, this is supposed to be fun. And it is. But be prepared to find yourself grappling with a whole lot more.","Aug 30, 2024"
Babygirl,2024,Halina Reijn,Variety,90,Owen Gleiberman,"Babygirl takes a few turns we don’t expect, but that’s because the movie’s ambition isn’t just to feed the thriller engine. It’s to capture something genuine about women’s erotic experience in the age of control.","Aug 30, 2024"

Ultimately, though, Babygirl comes to seem genuinely romantic, because Romy and Samuel are fumbling their way towards a deeper understanding of each other. As uncomfortable as the film may be, it's clear that Reijn loves and respects her damaged characters, even if they're not sure of how they feel about themselves.","Aug 30, 2024"

Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,Paste Magazine,81,Jesse Hassenger,"Nosferatu is a hell of a picture. If Eggers often appears to be reaching as far back as possible for his cinematic influences, riffing on a silent movie allows him – forces him, even – to reveal his more modern sensibilities, where men are repped by the contorted, strangled scream face of Hoult and the ineffectual Friedrich (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), whose wife Anna (Emma Corrin) is this story’s version of Lucy from Dracula. In a plague-ridden town, it’s Ellen’s visionary, full-tilt fever that allows her to more closely commune with the evil around her, maybe even finding a hint of sick ecstasy. Nosferatu, in its enveloping-shadow way, finds more than a hint.","Dec 2, 2024"

Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,BBC,80,Nicholas Barber,"As Eggers proceeds steadily and methodically through the events in Murnau's masterpiece, you may admire the intelligence and painstaking craft that has gone into it, but you may also have the feeling that you're watching actors playing time-honoured roles rather than real people in mortal danger. Horror fans needn't worry, though: Nosferatu has its share of gruesome shocks.","Dec 2, 2024"
Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,ScreenCrush,80,Matt Singer,"The reason to see this Nosferatu anyway is its handsomely detailed production, which is soaked in gothic atmosphere thanks to incredible design, cinematography, and that creepy Skarsgard performance.","Dec 7, 2024"

Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,ABC News,80,Peter Travers,Here’s your holiday counter-programming ticket to fear and trembling.

Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,The Observer (UK),80,Wendy Ide,"There’s something about the macabre sensuality and mossy, crepuscular gloom of this retelling of the vampire legend that leaves a mark on the audience. It’s not so much a viewing experience as a kind of haunting.","Dec 30, 2024"
Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,i,80,Christina Newland,"Obsessed by rooting his supernatural folk tales in the realities of historical life, Eggers turns Nosferatu into a gothic horror fairy-tale. It’s retro in the best sense of the word.","Jan 3, 2025"
Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,The A.V. Club,75,Katie Rife,"There are moments of genuine horror and genuine artfulness in Nosferatu, neither of which would have been possible if the writer-director had approached the project with tongue in cheek. But at two hours and 12 minutes, it’s a solemn death march towards an inevitable conclusion—which fits the theme, but strains the limits of audience engagement.","Dec 2, 2024"
Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,Consequence,75,Liz Shannon Miller,"Nosferatu delivers exactly what it promised — a new version of a classic tale, told by one of our most technically accomplished filmmakers. And this is certainly a more explicitly sexy version of Nosferatu than what the original German film delivered 102 years ago. However, it otherwise follows its source material, as well as the paths laid out by other adaptations, so faithfully that its most original elements feel drowned out by the familiar. It’s perhaps the best-made Dracula adaptation to come around in a long time. But it never feels essential.","Dec 2, 2024"
Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,LarsenOnFilm,75,Josh Larsen,"Nosferatu feels unique compared to other Dracula variations in the way this world appears drained—of color, light, nearly life itself. It’s as if blood has been sucked from the very images.","Dec 6, 2024"
Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,San Francisco Chronicle,75,G.

Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,USA Today,75,Brian Truitt,"Visually sumptuous and surprisingly sensual, ""Nosferatu"" isn’t as wonderfully original (or bonkers) as Eggers' top-notch flicks “The Witch” and “The Northman,” but great turns from Lily-Rose Depp and Bill Skarsgård sell its disturbing, otherworldly beauty-and-the-beast tale.","Dec 24, 2024"
Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,The Atlantic,75,David Sims,"The director’s meticulousness overtakes some scenes, crowding out any real sense of dread; occasionally his characters seemed to be drowning in the gorgeous, complex sets they were moving through.

Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,Movie Nation,75,Roger Moore,"Eggers indulges himself in all the tricks of the scary cinema’s trade — simple historic ffects given a digital boost in recreating an 1830s Europe of gloom, greys and shades of brown and red. The most chilling image is of the shadow of count’s clawed hand, stretching across a sleeping city, reaching for Ellen.","Dec 27, 2024"
Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,The Seattle Times,75,Soren Andersen,"It’s not the best Dracula movie of all time, though it aspires to that. Murnau’s original still leads the pack. But it certainly is the most stylish. Eggers is a filmmaker with astonishing visual flair.","Dec 28, 2024"
Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,The Film Verdict,71,Alonso Duralde,"Nosferatu offers all the atmospherics and the creeping dread that it should, but this version remains locked-in and static when it might have dared to explore new ground.

Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,The Irish Times,70,Tara Brady,"The first half of the film is spellbinding; Eggers and his cinematographer, Jarin Blaschke, brilliantly redeploy the grammar of German expressionism to make Dracula (or thereabouts) scary again.","Jan 2, 2025"

Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,Polygon,68,Oli Welsh,"Eggers has made a visually grand movie, with an impressively doomy atmosphere and one hell of a closing shot. As a finely wrought monument to the ultimate Gothic horror movie, it’s worth seeing. But as a new reading of one of the most resonant stories of the past 150 years, it rings hollow.","Jan 15, 2025"
Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,The Associated Press,63,Jocelyn Noveck,"Bring your hand warmers, toe warmers, heart warmers and soul warmers — this update of the 1922 silent vampire classic will chill you to the bone...But it may not terrify you. Everything in Robert Eggers’ faithful, even adoring remake, from his picturesque 19th century German town to those bleak mountain snowscapes leading to that (brrr) imposing castle in Transylvania, looks great. But with its stylized, often stilted dialogue and overly dramatic storytelling, it feels more like everyone is living in a quaint period painting rather than a world populated by real humans (and, well, vampires) made of flesh and, er, blood.","Dec 24, 2024"
Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,The Guardian,60,Peter Bradshaw,"It is an interesting new Nosferatu for our age of pandemic fear, with some beautiful images and striking moments, particularly in the eerie moonlit hallucination sequence at the beginning, which makes the rest of the story feel slightly literal and self-conscious.","Dec 2, 2024"

The Seed of the Sacred Fig,2024,Mohammad Rasoulof,Variety,90,Peter Debruge,"The situation Rasoulof depicts is hardly limited to Iran. There are echoes of Nazi Germany and modern-day China in the way average citizens submit, while the pressures to inform on one’s neighbors recall pre-perestroika Soviet policies. Rasoulof’s genius comes in focusing on how this dynamic plays out within a family, which makes it personal.","May 25, 2024"

The Seed of the Sacred Fig,2024,Mohammad Rasoulof,The Atlantic,78,Shirley Li,"The film is, as a result, a portrait of how Rasoulof perceives the systematic oppression within his home country, from which he is now exiled.

Adaptation,2002,Spike Jonze,The New Republic,20,Stanley Kauffmann,Virtually everything that happens in Adaptation is almost juvenile showing off - daring to make a film that is in search of a script.,
The Mighty Ducks,1992,Stephen Herek,San Francisco Chronicle,75,Peter Stack,"The Mighty Ducks is not going to be remembered as a cinematic treasure, but for a movie that's built on a fairly shaky framework, it delivers a good feeling you can take home. [02 Oct 1992, p.C5]",
The Mighty Ducks,1992,Stephen Herek,Orlando Sentinel,75,Allia Majeed,"Like many other Disney-produced movies, this one requires you to give yourself up to the fantastic elements of the story in order to enjoy it fully. If you dwell on the improbabilities, you'll miss the good parts. [09 Oct 1992, p.22]",
The Mighty Ducks,1992,Stephen Herek,Variety,70,Staff (Not Credited),"Helmer Stephen Herek endows a familiar story with a crisp look and swift tempo, seldom allowing sanctimonious tale to linger too long or gags to get too tiresome.",
The Mighty Ducks,1992,Stephen Herek,Chicago Tribune,63,Gene Siskel,"An okay kids' picture about a bunch of misfit hockey players who are brought together to play in the Big Game by a cynical, Yuppie coach (Emilio Estevez) doing community service. [02 Oct 1992, p.C]",
The Mighty Ducks,1992,Stephen Herek,Miami Herald,63,Jackie Potts,"The Mighty Ducks is an upbeat, quick-paced family movie. [06 Oct 1992, p.C5]",
The Mighty Ducks,1992,Stephen Herek,The Seattle Times,63,Jeff Shannon,"The Mighty Ducks hasn't got a single fresh idea in its 100 fluffily formulaic minutes, so it's surprising that the film is quite easy to enjoy. [02 Oct 1992, p.27]",
The Mighty Ducks,1992,Stephen Herek,The New York Times,60,Janet Maslin,"As directed by Stephen Herek, The Mighty Ducks moves energetically but lacks the enjoyable quirkiness of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, which Mr. Herek also directed.",
The Mighty Ducks,1992,Stephen Herek,Chicago Sun-Times,50,Roger Ebert,"It must be said that this movie is sweet and innocent, and that at a certain level it might appeal to younger kids. I doubt if its ambitions reach much beyond that.",
The Mighty Ducks,1992,Stephen Herek,TV Guide Magazine,50,,"THE MIGHTY DUCKS is harmless enough, but its schematic retread of a screenplay and its lethargic acting detracts from the unassuming, passable entertainment it might have been.",
The Mighty Ducks,1992,Stephen Herek,Washington Post,50,Rita Kempley,"Steven Brill, who has a small role in the film, constructed the screenplay much as one would put together some of those particleboard bookcases from Ikea.",
The Mighty Ducks,1992,Stephen Herek,Boston Globe,50,Jay Carr,"Herek's brisk pacing and skillful way with the hockey sequences gives The Mighty Ducks an urgency its manipulative copycat soul doesn't really earn. The Mighty Ducks - with its team calculatedly organized along gender as well as multi-cultural lines - is the kind of film kids like, then outgrow. [02 Oct 1992, p.49]",
The Mighty Ducks,1992,Stephen Herek,USA Today,50,Staff (Not Credited),"Perhaps there's a legion of 10 and unders who don't know The Bad News Bears from the Care Bears.

The Mighty Ducks,1992,Stephen Herek,Entertainment Weekly,42,Jill Rachlin,"The film spends most of its time tracing Bombay’s predictable transformation from supercompetitive to supercompassionate coach, a metamorphosis that will most likely bore young audiences who don’t yet know what a mid-life crisis is, let alone identify with one.",
The Mighty Ducks,1992,Stephen Herek,Tampa Bay Times,42,Steve Persall,"Director Stephen Herek (Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure) and screenwriter Steve Brill dreamed up these fantasies for their so-called comedy about youth hockey. They could have devoted more attention to writing decent jokes. This childish mix of slap shots and slapstick lumbers along as awkwardly as a skater on a melting ice rink. [02 Oct 1992, p.12]",

The Mighty Ducks,1992,Stephen Herek,Los Angeles Times,40,Michael Wilmington,"Most of the movie is like the ice on which Bombay's limousine rests: cold and shaky. The only time it really comes alive is in the obvious scene, the fast, furious championship, with every Duck having his day.",

The Mighty Ducks,1992,Stephen Herek,Time Out London,20,,"Very lame ice-hockey flick. Estevez is arrogant hot-shot lawyer Gordon Bombay, condemned to community service for drink-driving. He reckons he can go one-on-one with his troubled past and get back at his boss by coaching a team of little league no-hopers (cast from a cupboard marked 'brats, assorted').",
The Next Karate Kid,1994,Christopher Cain,San Francisco Chronicle,63,Peter Stack,"The Next Karate Kid' has all the makings of a terrible movie, but it never quite becomes one. One reason might be that cinematographer Laszlo Kovacs just loves a beautiful picture. [10 Sep 1994, p.E6]",
The Next Karate Kid,1994,Christopher Cain,Variety,50,Lisa Nesselson,"Leisurely and overly familiar pic should appeal to young teen girls, but won't be breaking any B.O. bricks with its bare hands.",
The Next Karate Kid,1994,Christopher Cain,Washington Post,50,Rita Kempley,"The fourth film in the series, the newest installment has a new director, Chris Cain, and a female Kid, Hilary Swank, but otherwise it reprises the formula established by John G. Avildsen in 1984: A troubled teen conquers self-doubt and the local bullies with the help of an enigmatic karate teacher.",
The Next Karate Kid,1994,Christopher Cain,Los Angeles Times,50,Chris Willman,"If this installment is just slightly less laborious than Karate Kid II or III, it's not from Mark Lee's surprise-free script or Christopher Cain's placid direction, but because young Swank really might be a find. Early on, she's such a convincingly testy teen that parents may flinch, but she does seem to blossom before your eyes.",
The Next Karate Kid,1994,Christopher Cain,Baltimore Sun,50,Stephen Hunter,This film feels like a desperate attempt to squeeze a few last bucks out of what was once a very obliging cash cow.,

The Next Karate Kid,1994,Christopher Cain,Entertainment Weekly,42,Lisa Schwarzbaum,"Clearly, three sequels haven’t improved Miyagi’s English, but there is something bitchin’ about seeing a babe give a bully a good thwack. Not that girls will go see this or boys will care.",

The Next Karate Kid,1994,Christopher Cain,Austin Chronicle,40,Marc Savlov,"There's really nothing new here (as if anyone expected there would be), but it's a decent enough entry into the Karate Kid series, if you don't mind having seen it all done before, and better.",

The Next Karate Kid,1994,Christopher Cain,Philadelphia Inquirer,38,Carrie Rickey,"All things are possible, Julie-san, Miyagi constantly encourages his young charge. All things may be possible, Miyagi-sensei, but not this movie. [10 Sep 1994, p.D9]",
The Next Karate Kid,1994,Christopher Cain,The New York Times,30,Stephen Holden,"The Next Karate Kid doesn't even try to achieve surface credibility.

The Next Karate Kid,1994,Christopher Cain,Chicago Tribune,25,Clifford Terry,It should be obvious to anyone at this point in time that Kid is getting a little long in the tooth. As Miyagi might say: Those who keep milking same idea . . . end up killing cash cow.,
The Next Karate Kid,1994,Christopher Cain,Tampa Bay Times,16,Steve Persall,"The Next Karate Kid is equally pointless; a fourth installment of a series  that stopped kicking and started creaking in round 2. [11 Sep 1994, p.18C]",
