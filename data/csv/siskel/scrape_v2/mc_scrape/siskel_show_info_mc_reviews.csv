MISERICORDIA,2024,Alain Guiraudie,The Playlist,100,Ankit Jhunjhunwala,"This is rigorous filmmaking of the highest order, controlled and precise to the exclusion of anything extraneous —evidenced by its taut 100-minute runtime.","May 27, 2024"
MISERICORDIA,2024,Alain Guiraudie,The Globe and Mail (Toronto),100,Saffron Maeve,"With Misericordia, Guiraudie deftly strikes the balance between the playfully sacrilegious and the sociopathic, rounded out by a seductively bizarre cast of dwellers and clusters of puckered, corpse-fed mushrooms.","Mar 26, 2025"
MISERICORDIA,2024,Alain Guiraudie,The Film Stage,91,Leonardo Goi,"For all its morbid undertones and philosophical ruminations, Misericordia is neither a dirge nor a lofty symposium. Strange as it may be to say for a story that begins with a burial and then shatters after a heinous death, this is a supremely and surprisingly funny film, where humor gradually accrues a subversiveness not unlike desire’s own.","May 27, 2024"

MISERICORDIA,2024,Alain Guiraudie,The New York Times,90,Wesley Morris,"Misericordia is film noir with the lights turned on. Even when its characters are working your nerves, it tickles. Guiraudie is playing those nerves like a harp.","Mar 20, 2025"
MISERICORDIA,2024,Alain Guiraudie,The Daily Beast,88,Nick Schager,"A superb thriller that employs common genre devices for a canny and caustic rumination on right and wrong, love and lust, virtue and vice.","Mar 18, 2025"
MISERICORDIA,2024,Alain Guiraudie,RogerEbert.com,88,Simon Abrams,"It’s not a hard movie to follow or fall for, as fans of Guiraudie’s earlier movies already know. He commands our attention even when his characters are either too ridiculous or too petty to be taken seriously.","Mar 21, 2025"
MISERICORDIA,2024,Alain Guiraudie,Screen Daily,80,Jonathan Romney,"This might suggest that Misericordia is ultimately a film with a message, and a more solemn one than we’re used to with Guiraudie. But any apparent clarity should be taken with a pinch of salt, the film’s meanings shifting as constantly as the erotic drives between the various male (and occasionally female) characters.","May 27, 2024"

MISERICORDIA,2024,Alain Guiraudie,Los Angeles Times,80,Joshua Rothkopf,"This isn’t the kind of puzzle thriller in which all the elements click into place with a thudding literalism that compliments an attentive eye.

MISERICORDIA,2024,Alain Guiraudie,Slant Magazine,75,Brad Hanford,"Misericordia finds Alain Guiraudie revisiting old standbys under a relatively conventional set of aesthetic strategies. Fortunately, the ideas roiling under the former wildman’s newly placid surfaces are as potent as ever.","Sep 10, 2024"
MISERICORDIA,2024,Alain Guiraudie,The A.V. Club,75,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,"While it lacks the surrealistic and fairy-tale elements that distinguish many of Guiraudie’s films (among them Sunshine For The Poor, Time Has Come, and Staying Vertical), Misericordia is nonetheless pervaded by a casual dreaminess and a disregard for the strictures of realism that leads in some (intentionally) silly directions.","Mar 20, 2025"
MISERICORDIA,2024,Alain Guiraudie,Original-Cin,75,Liz Braun,"Moments of brilliance notwithstanding, the comedy and the dark look at human nature in Misericordia never quite meld. For any student of human nature, that unreliable narrator and the gang of unlikeable characters may eventually wear thin.","Mar 25, 2025"
MISERICORDIA,2024,Alain Guiraudie,The Hollywood Reporter,70,Jordan Mintzer,"The two movies don’t always crystallize into one, and if you’re looking for a credible crime thriller in which everyone behaves logically, Misericordia may not be for you. If, on the other hand, you’re looking for an exploration of repressed sexual desire and religious hypocrisy in backwoods France, Guiraudie’s strange and sober new film does the trick.","May 27, 2024"
MISERICORDIA,2024,Alain Guiraudie,Wall Street Journal,70,Zachary Barnes,"By its end, “Misericordia” emerges as a drama by turns chilling and absurd, with some of its twists daring us toward incredulity. Yet Mr. Guiraudie’s mix of mischief-making and straight-faced conviction keeps us continuously unsettled, and continuously curious.","Mar 20, 2025"
MISERICORDIA,2024,Alain Guiraudie,Paste Magazine,68,Jim Vorel,"At times arrestingly suspenseful, at others bitterly funny, but often inert in its transitions, Misericordia is an occasionally confounding mixed bag, but one that stands out for the realistic recriminations of a place where grievances run deep and mercy comes with strings attached.","Mar 21, 2025"
JULIE KEEPS QUIET,2024,Leonardo Van Dijl,The New York Times,80,Nicolas Rapold,It’s a film that maintains that Julie’s story is available only when she’s ready to tell it.,"Mar 27, 2025"
JULIE KEEPS QUIET,2024,Leonardo Van Dijl,RogerEbert.com,75,Monica Castillo,"Leonardo van Dijl’’s “Julie Keeps Quiet” is more about what is left unsaid than what’s spoken. Co-written by van Dijl and Ruth Becquart, the film is a quiet drama about keeping secrets buried within and what happens when details finally come to light.","Mar 28, 2025"
FIRST REFORMED,2018,Paul Schrader,Slant Magazine,100,Greg Cwik,"After more than 20 features, Paul Schrader has been reborn with First Reformed, an unhurried, furious, deeply agonized look at faith and skepticism that’s as reverent as it is blasphemous.","May 11, 2018"
FIRST REFORMED,2018,Paul Schrader,Village Voice,100,Alan Scherstuhl,"The conflicts Schrader exposes are too pressing, too raw, too obvious in their own right to demand subtlety. That makes First Reformed a fascinating work of almost mixed media: Ingmar Bergman and Robert Bresson meet outraged editorial cartooning meet the it-always-builds-to-violence pulp sensibility of the movie brats. The mix is volatile, enraging, entrancing.","May 16, 2018"
FIRST REFORMED,2018,Paul Schrader,Movie Nation,100,Roger Moore,"It’s a powerful, disturbing crisis of faith drama that takes on the raiments of a thriller, and a tour de force for the understated acting of Ethan Hawke.","May 16, 2018"

FIRST REFORMED,2018,Paul Schrader,San Francisco Chronicle,100,Mick LaSalle,"First Reformed has a confidence about it, the presence of filmmaking consciousness that can’t do wrong, because this time he knows exactly what he wants to say, not only in a general sense, but second by second and shot by shot.","May 23, 2018"

FIRST REFORMED,2018,Paul Schrader,Vanity Fair,100,K. Austin Collins,"Schrader’s film is a wise, shocking, intellectually prodigious masterpiece. It’s a classic Schrader slow burn that seems to reach, in its final moments, for the impossible.","May 24, 2018"
FIRST REFORMED,2018,Paul Schrader,Washington Post,100,Ann Hornaday,"At once ruminative and shocking, godwardly inclined and repellently graphic, First Reformed is indisputably the finest film Schrader has directed since his sensitive adaptation of Russell Banks’s novel “Affliction.”","May 25, 2018"
FIRST REFORMED,2018,Paul Schrader,Vox,100,Alissa Wilkinson,"It’s a remarkable addition to the small but growing canon of American films that aren’t afraid to stare straight into an abyss with all of the implications — moral, ethical, political, and religious — that are required for this moment in our history. First Reformed is a confounding stunner of a movie and richly deserves our full, serious attention.","Jun 14, 2018"

FIRST REFORMED,2018,Paul Schrader,Variety,90,Owen Gleiberman,"In First Reformed, Paul Schrader courts respectability and leaves it in the dust, getting stoned on excess. But make no mistake: He’s still one hell of a filmmaker.",
FIRST REFORMED,2018,Paul Schrader,Time,90,Stephanie Zacharek,"Part of the movie’s understated triumph lies in its casting: Hawke is an actor who clearly cares, and worries, a lot–the tree of life is practically etched into his forehead.","May 17, 2018"
FIRST REFORMED,2018,Paul Schrader,Wall Street Journal,90,Joe Morgenstern,"Grapples with eternal questions of faith, to be sure, but confronts just as powerfully, if not more so, the urgent matter of how to live a good, useful life in the turbulent here and the terrifying now. First Reformed has its steeple in the clouds and its foundation on solid ground.","May 17, 2018"
FIRST REFORMED,2018,Paul Schrader,Los Angeles Times,90,Justin Chang,"It is an exquisite piece of filmmaking and also a blunt, pulpy instrument, a despairing, fully sustained howl of a movie that is easily this director's finest work in years.","May 17, 2018"
FIRST REFORMED,2018,Paul Schrader,ScreenCrush,90,E. Oliver Whitney,"First Reformed is the type of film that leaves you with more profound questions than answers.

FIRST REFORMED,2018,Paul Schrader,Chicago Sun-Times,88,Richard Roeper,"With First Reformed, Schrader delivers his most impactful work in years, with Ethan Hawke’s haunting and brilliant work as Ernst Toller joining the ranks of great lead performances in Schrader films.

FIRST REFORMED,2018,Paul Schrader,The Globe and Mail (Toronto),88,John Semley,First Reformed may well be the ultimate auteur object for Schrader apostles.

FIRST REFORMED,2018,Paul Schrader,St. Louis Post-Dispatch,88,Calvin Wilson,"In one of his best roles, Hawke is galvanizing as a man who has lost his way and is desperately searching for meaning in his life.

FIRST REFORMED,2018,Paul Schrader,The Telegraph,80,Robbie Collin,"First Reformed doesn’t come off as pastiche, or a raking-up of old ideas – largely because Schrader and his cast commit to the project with sharpened and unblinking seriousness, even when the going gets mesmerically weird.",
FIRST REFORMED,2018,Paul Schrader,Empire,80,Ian Freer,"Schrader’s best in yonks, a powerful meditation on faith’s place in the modern world. Hawke, as a kind of Travis Bickle in a dog collar, gives one of the performances of the year.","Jul 16, 2018"
FIRST REFORMED,2018,Paul Schrader,Entertainment Weekly,75,Chris Nashawaty,"First Reformed is a bleak, punishing movie and the furthest thing imaginable from an easy crowdpleaser. But Hawke juices it with an austere sense of grace.","May 18, 2018"
FIRST REFORMED,2018,Paul Schrader,Uproxx,75,Vince Mancini,"First Reformed is bleak and bone dry, a little self-indulgent, and it screams neither “fun” nor “production values.” It is the opposite of a “romp.” But damned if it doesn’t stay with you.","May 24, 2018"

FIRST REFORMED,2018,Paul Schrader,New York Magazine (Vulture),70,David Edelstein,"First Reformed is rigorously austere (as befits the author of Transcendental Style in Film), but every frame suggests a longing for a world elsewhere.

FIRST REFORMED,2018,Paul Schrader,Christian Science Monitor,67,Peter Rainer,"Schrader’s chief influence here, as in many of his other films, is the great French director Robert Bresson, especially his “Diary of a Country Priest.” But Bresson’s spare stylistics achieved a sublimity while Schrader’s, though intermittently powerful, too often feel schematic.","May 18, 2018"

LATE SPRING,1949,Yasujirô Ozu,The A.V. Club,100,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,"Each shot in Late Spring is striking on its own; the mature Ozu belongs to that rare category of filmmakers whose work can be recognized from a single frame. But together—with all their abrupt shifts in visual perspective and time—they become a mosaic, deeply poignant and ultimately mysterious in the way it envisions a relationship between two people trapped by how much they care for one another.",
LATE SPRING,1949,Yasujirô Ozu,Chicago Sun-Times,100,Roger Ebert,Late Spring is one of the best two or three films Ozu ever made.,
LATE SPRING,1949,Yasujirô Ozu,IndieWire,100,Oliver Lyttelton,"It could, from premise alone, sound like an Austen-ish comedy of manners, and perhaps the film that Ozu might have made early in his career. Here, though, it’s an immaculate, gentle drama in which society gets in the way of the happiness of a father and daughter, and growing up and moving away isn’t so much a victory as a bitter cost of time and change.",
LATE SPRING,1949,Yasujirô Ozu,Paste Magazine,100,Robert Davis,An understated masterpiece,
LATE SPRING,1949,Yasujirô Ozu,Village Voice,100,Stuart Byron,"You either get it or you don't. I get it. At least until I see some Ozus I've missed, Late Spring seems to me his greatest achievement, and, thus, one of the 10 best films of all time. [17 Aug 1972, p.57]",
LATE SPRING,1949,Yasujirô Ozu,TV Guide Magazine,100,Staff (Not Credited),"One is left with an overwhelming sense of knowledge about these characters and of human nature, and finally, a recognition of the profound sadness of everyday life. LATE SPRING is truly transcendent.",
LATE SPRING,1949,Yasujirô Ozu,Chicago Tribune,100,Michael Wilmington,"The actors who play these parts--Chishu Ryu as the father and Setsuko Hara as the daughter--are the most emblematic members of Ozu's famous stock company. Her warm beauty and his stoic rigor--and the frequent smiles both use to cover their feelings--convey oceans of meaning beneath the drama's polite, humorous, carefully etched surface, where immaculate interiors and lovely scenery reflect a world in very delicate balance. [07 Jan 2005, p.C2]",
LATE SPRING,1949,Yasujirô Ozu,Christian Science Monitor,100,David Sterritt,"Superb performances by Setsuko Hara and the great Chishu Ryu also contribute to the film's impact, which is at once deeply moving and profoundly thoughtful about moral and spiritual issues. [10 Nov 1994, p.12]",
LATE SPRING,1949,Yasujirô Ozu,San Francisco Chronicle,100,G. Allen Johnson,"To watch Ozu's films is to watch elegant simplicity, although they are meticulously complex.

LATE SPRING,1949,Yasujirô Ozu,Chicago Reader,90,Dave Kehr,"Yasujiro Ozu’s 1949 film inaugurated his majestic late period: it’s here that he decisively renounces melodrama (and, indeed, most surface action of any kind) and lets his camera settle into the still, long-take contemplation of his gently drawn characters.",
LATE SPRING,1949,Yasujirô Ozu,The New Yorker,90,Richard Brody,"Rigid formality leaves much unsaid in Yasujiro Ozu’s 1949 film, but the director reveals the hidden depths of ordinary life with a quiet astonishment and observes his characters with an exacting subtlety of expression.",

LATE SPRING,1949,Yasujirô Ozu,LarsenOnFilm,88,Josh Larsen,"We observe family dynamics that could take place in any home, at any time; as Noriko and Shukichi tentatively negotiate the future of their family, they’re enacting a story that’s both distinct to post-war Japan and straight from the pages of Jane Austen.",
LATE SPRING,1949,Yasujirô Ozu,Slant Magazine,88,Jaime N. Christley,"Few films have expressed, with as much force and lyricism as Ozu’s Late Spring, the various emotions (melancholy, bittersweet joy, impassioned regret, taciturn resignation) associated with the ongoing, perpetual dissolution of “the world as we know it.”",
LATE SPRING,1949,Yasujirô Ozu,Portland Oregonian,88,Staff (Not Credited),"It’s considered the first of Ozu’s string of late-career masterpieces, which makes it a must-see for any fan of cinema. [10 Jun 2016]",
LATE SPRING,1949,Yasujirô Ozu,The New York Times,80,Vincent Canby,"Ozu's recognition of the wall of skin separating the mind of the character from the viewer is an integral part of his philosophy. It amounts to a profound respect for their privacy, for the mystery of their emotions. Because of this—not in spite of this—his films, of which Late Spring is one of the finest, are so moving.",
LATE SPRING,1949,Yasujirô Ozu,Time Out,80,Staff (Not Credited),"This is a remarkable, piercing film, and central to an understanding of Ozu's work.",
LATE SPRING,1949,Yasujirô Ozu,Empire,60,Kim Newman,"Not as affecting as Ozu's classic Tokyo Story, Late Spring still charms with it's similar theme of development of the parental bond as the children mature and become more independent. Although well acted, the visual are equally arresting but when the themes are so similar a new approach is required to keep it interesting.",
ERIC LARUE,2024,Michael Shannon,The Hollywood Reporter,80,David Rooney,"There’s no escaping the fact that Eric Larue is a downer, but it’s a work of thoughtful intelligence and restraint, elegantly shot and graced by a striking score from Jonathan Mastro full of dissonant strings that often evoke a sense of nerves about to shatter.

ERIC LARUE,2024,Michael Shannon,The A.V. Club,58,Brianna Zigler,"Though carried by a subtle and strenuous performance from Greer, Eric LaRue‘s intentionally unanswered questions do less to provoke than render the film a collage of well-meaning, half-finished sentiments.","Apr 2, 2025"
ERIC LARUE,2024,Michael Shannon,Collider,50,Taylor Gates,"There are several interesting ideas and stories floating around Eric LaRue, but Shannon can’t seem to decide which ones to focus on. While there are some genuinely fantastic, inspired moments, they frustratingly never quite come together, leading to a baffling viewing experience. Hopefully, Greer will get another chance in the spotlight of a more worthy film.","Jun 15, 2023"
ERIC LARUE,2024,Michael Shannon,Slant Magazine,50,Pat Brown,"While the film features a strong performance from Judy Greer, it’s essentially a patchwork of broad strokes that rarely feel like they’re bringing its world to credible life.","Apr 1, 2025"
