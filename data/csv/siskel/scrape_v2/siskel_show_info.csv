Set against a backdrop of slick and superficial luxury, with a star-making performance by Gere (and all those incredible Armani suits) AMERICAN GIGOLO is an intelligent thriller ahead of its time, and a profound exploration of the commodification of love and desire.

K. Ratkje. Throughout, Satz also looks ahead, asking how the siren might be reimagined to better attune us to the interconnected responsibilities of our shared future. Followed by a conversation with the artist."

Unfolding in almost real time, MISTRESS DISPELLER follows “Teacher” Wang as she clandestinely befriends both the cheating husband and the mistress, all part of her intricate master plan to restore the family’s equilibrium. “A spellbindingly intimate tale” (POV Magazine), this exquisitely photographed docu-drama is “a profound and searching panorama of loneliness and partnership,” (IndieWire) and a “highly effective [and] delicately realized examination of marriage in modern China (Screen Daily)."

Minh-ha,90,Shadows of War Lecture Series,,USA/South Korea/Germany,In Vietnamese with English subtitles | Format: Digital,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//forgetting-vietnam,FORGETTING VIETNAM,"Highly influential as a feminist and postcolonial theorist, Trinh T. Minh-ha’s experimental films challenge narrative and cinematic conventions while raising critical social issues. FORGETTING VIETNAM combines footage from 1995 and 2012, and is a mediation on the legacy of Vietnam in contemporary society framed by two ancient myths: that Vietnam was formed when two fighting dragons fell into the South China Sea; and that the origin of Viet people traces back to the union between a fairy and a dragon."
