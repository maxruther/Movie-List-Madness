TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Screen Daily,100,John Hazelton,Tangerine paints a portrait of transgender sex workers and their clients that pulses with raunchy energy and compassionate humour. It’s a bracing slice of American indie film-making.,"Jul 7, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Los Angeles Times,100,Rebecca Keegan,"With a witty and efficient script by director Sean Baker and co-writer Chris Bergoch, Tangerine peels back the curtain on a fascinating Los Angeles microculture.","Jul 9, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,The New York Times,100,Manohla Dargis,"Tangerine encompasses dizzying multitudes — it’s a neo-screwball chase flick with a dash of Rainer Werner Fassbinder — but mostly, movingly, it is a female-friendship movie about two people who each started life with an XY chromosome set.","Jul 9, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,New York Magazine (Vulture),100,David Edelstein,"What’s extraordinary about Tangerine is that it’s everything an entertaining, old-fashioned, mainstream Hollywood comedy should be but no longer is. That nowadays you have to get this kind of stuff via Sundance from directors using iPhones is a drag — the wrong kind.","Jul 9, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,San Francisco Chronicle,100,David Lewis,"This is sublime filmmaking, a textbook example of how indies can tell groundbreaking stories in a way that Hollywood simply can’t match.","Jul 16, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Slate,100,Dana Stevens,"A sneaky slice-of-life indie that comes on all casual and cinéma-verité in the early scenes, then slowly coalesces into a romantic comedy as intricately constructed as any door-slamming stage farce.","Jul 21, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Time Out,100,David Ehrlich,"A saturated picture that courses with the raw energy of found footage while still feeling artfully composed, a movie that punches with the skittering violence of dubstep but careens through L.A. with the unbridled freedom of bebop jazz.","Jul 21, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Salon,100,Andrew O'Hehir,"This is a gorgeous, timely and possibly profound human comedy, and if there’s no disentangling the medium from the message that’s because both are powerful and ambiguous.","Jul 21, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,The Telegraph,100,Robbie Collin,"It radiates a candour, immediacy and tongue-scalding sex appeal that a bigger budget would have only smothered.","Nov 15, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,IndieWire,91,Eric Kohn,Baker once again manages to match underrepresented faces in American cinema with material that lets their personalities shine.,"Jan 31, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,The Playlist,91,Katie Walsh,"Utilizing underseen subjects, [Baker] captures their world in a thoughtful and artful way, and it also happens to be a damn fun ride.","Jan 31, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Entertainment Weekly,91,Joe McGovern,Tangerine is touching for its non-condescending stance toward working girls and the spirit of the sidewalk.,"Jul 7, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,The Hollywood Reporter,90,David Rooney,"The film's smart craftsmanship is ultimately less noteworthy than its humanizing, prejudice-challenging immersion into the lives of people who inhabit L.A.'s low-end drug and sex industry.","Jan 31, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Variety,90,Justin Chang,"Writer-director Sean Baker’s sun-scorched, street-level snapshot is a work of rueful, matter-of-fact insight and unapologetically wild humor that draws a motley collection of funny, sad and desperate individuals into its protagonists’ orbit.","Jan 31, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Village Voice,90,Stephanie Zacharek,"In the early minutes you might not be sure what you're watching. Tangerine's a comedy, of course, laced with rambunctious, exuberantly ragged dialogue. But by the end, Baker and his actors have led us to a place beyond comedy — you may still be laughing, but your breath catches a little on the way out.","Jul 7, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,New York Post,88,Sara Stewart,"The two working girls at the center of Tangerine are played by engaging newcomers: Kitana Kiki Rodriguez as the freshly out-of-jail Sin-Dee Rella, and Mya Taylor as her best friend Alexandra.","Jul 8, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Rolling Stone,88,Peter Travers,A groundbreaking film that leaves you in stitches while quietly breaking your heart.,"Jul 9, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Philadelphia Inquirer,88,Steven Rea,"Baker gets great, sly, unforced performances from his two leads, but it's not all a rollicking good time: There are moments of quietude, inquietude, moments when a sense of wariness and loneliness settles over the women.","Jul 24, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,The A.V. Club,83,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,"It’s the movie’s quietest, softest moments that register most strongly, be it Alexandra’s low-key performance of Victor Herbert’s “Toyland” to an almost empty bar, or the final scene, which finds her and Sin-Dee alone in a Laundromat at the end of a long, bad night.","Jul 8, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Portland Oregonian,83,Marc Mohan,"Baker's previous films ""Take Out"" and ""Starlet"" have focused on populations generally treated with disdain by mainstream society -- illegal immigrants and porn performers, respectively. With Tangerine he continues to prove that by depicting these characters in all their flaws and majesty, movies can inspire awareness of our shared humanity. And make us laugh.","Jul 17, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Wall Street Journal,80,Joe Morgenstern,The film is clearly not for everyone; sometimes it wasn’t for me. But it’s steadfastly nonjudgmental and wonderfully tender toward two searchers for new versions of old-fashioned love.,"Jul 9, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Arizona Republic,80,Bill Goodykoontz,"Rodriguez and Taylor are terrific. Their confidence is infectious, yet they never let us forget the challenges their lives offer.","Jul 23, 2015"

TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,CineVue,80,Patrick Gamble,"Poetic realism for a digital age, Tangerine also shares a lot of qualities with the cinema of Mike Leigh and Ken Loach. There's no cheap manipulation here and Baker's characters never come across as victims.","Nov 15, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Austin Chronicle,78,Steve Davis,"Tangerine’s greatest accomplishment, however, lies with director Baker, who filmed the movie using an iPhone 5S. It’s an amazing achievement – the fluidity of the camerawork is exhilarating at times, the intimacy of the close-ups sometimes unsettling.","Jul 22, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Slant Magazine,75,Ed Gonzalez,"Its triumph is primarily a matter of style, a visionary revelation every bit as expressionistic as its main character's electric sense of shade.","Jun 28, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Movie Nation,75,Roger Moore,"A feisty, funny, down-and-dirty farce as nasty as a Supreme Court dissent, as timely as a Jenner magazine cover.","Jul 7, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,TheWrap,75,Inkoo Kang,"The film bustles along through a series of reveals – a storytelling technique that can lose an audience’s sympathy or suspension of disbelief pretty fast, but which works flawlessly here because the filmmakers and the performers know exactly who their characters are and what kind of world they live in.","Jul 9, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,RogerEbert.com,75,Matt Zoller Seitz,"As written by Sean Baker and Chris Bergoch and directed by Baker, it's assured and immensely likable, and truly independent in story and style.","Jul 10, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Washington Post,75,Ann Hornaday,"As one character observes in Tangerine, Los Angeles is “a beautifully wrapped lie.” Baker has created a fitting homage to artifice and the often tawdry, tender realities that lie beneath.","Jul 16, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,St. Louis Post-Dispatch,75,Calvin Wilson,"Although the story of Sin-Dee and Alexandra might have benefited from a bit more structure, it’s a window into a world of which many people are unaware — but a world that has its share of dreamers.","Aug 6, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,The New Yorker,70,Richard Brody,"Baker revels in the power of clichés and the generic energy of his low-fi cinematography, which is done with a cell phone. The results are picturesque and anecdotal.","Jul 7, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Boston Globe,63,Peter Keough,Subtlety and irony are not among the film’s virtues.,"Jul 16, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,New York Daily News,60,Jordan Hoffman,"Tangerine offers a warts-and-all depiction of a subculture seldom treated with respect by straight society. The movie handles it in a sincere way that’s entertaining, too.","Jul 9, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,New Orleans Times-Picayune,40,Mike Scott,"Like the rest of the film, it's has its laughs and it has its emotion, just not enough of either.","Sep 18, 2015"
