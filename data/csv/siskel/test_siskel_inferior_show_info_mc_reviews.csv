TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Screen Daily,100,John Hazelton,Tangerine paints a portrait of transgender sex workers and their clients that pulses with raunchy energy and compassionate humour. It’s a bracing slice of American indie film-making.,"Jul 7, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Los Angeles Times,100,Rebecca Keegan,"With a witty and efficient script by director Sean Baker and co-writer Chris Bergoch, Tangerine peels back the curtain on a fascinating Los Angeles microculture.","Jul 9, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,The New York Times,100,Manohla Dargis,"Tangerine encompasses dizzying multitudes — it’s a neo-screwball chase flick with a dash of Rainer Werner Fassbinder — but mostly, movingly, it is a female-friendship movie about two people who each started life with an XY chromosome set.","Jul 9, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,New York Magazine (Vulture),100,David Edelstein,"What’s extraordinary about Tangerine is that it’s everything an entertaining, old-fashioned, mainstream Hollywood comedy should be but no longer is. That nowadays you have to get this kind of stuff via Sundance from directors using iPhones is a drag — the wrong kind.","Jul 9, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,San Francisco Chronicle,100,David Lewis,"This is sublime filmmaking, a textbook example of how indies can tell groundbreaking stories in a way that Hollywood simply can’t match.","Jul 16, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Slate,100,Dana Stevens,"A sneaky slice-of-life indie that comes on all casual and cinéma-verité in the early scenes, then slowly coalesces into a romantic comedy as intricately constructed as any door-slamming stage farce.","Jul 21, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Time Out,100,David Ehrlich,"A saturated picture that courses with the raw energy of found footage while still feeling artfully composed, a movie that punches with the skittering violence of dubstep but careens through L.A. with the unbridled freedom of bebop jazz.","Jul 21, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Salon,100,Andrew O'Hehir,"This is a gorgeous, timely and possibly profound human comedy, and if there’s no disentangling the medium from the message that’s because both are powerful and ambiguous.","Jul 21, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,The Telegraph,100,Robbie Collin,"It radiates a candour, immediacy and tongue-scalding sex appeal that a bigger budget would have only smothered.","Nov 15, 2015"

TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Entertainment Weekly,91,Joe McGovern,Tangerine is touching for its non-condescending stance toward working girls and the spirit of the sidewalk.,"Jul 7, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,The Hollywood Reporter,90,David Rooney,"The film's smart craftsmanship is ultimately less noteworthy than its humanizing, prejudice-challenging immersion into the lives of people who inhabit L.A.'s low-end drug and sex industry.","Jan 31, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Variety,90,Justin Chang,"Writer-director Sean Baker’s sun-scorched, street-level snapshot is a work of rueful, matter-of-fact insight and unapologetically wild humor that draws a motley collection of funny, sad and desperate individuals into its protagonists’ orbit.","Jan 31, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Village Voice,90,Stephanie Zacharek,"In the early minutes you might not be sure what you're watching. Tangerine's a comedy, of course, laced with rambunctious, exuberantly ragged dialogue. But by the end, Baker and his actors have led us to a place beyond comedy — you may still be laughing, but your breath catches a little on the way out.","Jul 7, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,New York Post,88,Sara Stewart,"The two working girls at the center of Tangerine are played by engaging newcomers: Kitana Kiki Rodriguez as the freshly out-of-jail Sin-Dee Rella, and Mya Taylor as her best friend Alexandra.","Jul 8, 2015"

TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Philadelphia Inquirer,88,Steven Rea,"Baker gets great, sly, unforced performances from his two leads, but it's not all a rollicking good time: There are moments of quietude, inquietude, moments when a sense of wariness and loneliness settles over the women.","Jul 24, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,The A.V. Club,83,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,"It’s the movie’s quietest, softest moments that register most strongly, be it Alexandra’s low-key performance of Victor Herbert’s “Toyland” to an almost empty bar, or the final scene, which finds her and Sin-Dee alone in a Laundromat at the end of a long, bad night.","Jul 8, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Portland Oregonian,83,Marc Mohan,"Baker's previous films ""Take Out"" and ""Starlet"" have focused on populations generally treated with disdain by mainstream society -- illegal immigrants and porn performers, respectively. With Tangerine he continues to prove that by depicting these characters in all their flaws and majesty, movies can inspire awareness of our shared humanity. And make us laugh.","Jul 17, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Wall Street Journal,80,Joe Morgenstern,The film is clearly not for everyone; sometimes it wasn’t for me. But it’s steadfastly nonjudgmental and wonderfully tender toward two searchers for new versions of old-fashioned love.,"Jul 9, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Arizona Republic,80,Bill Goodykoontz,"Rodriguez and Taylor are terrific. Their confidence is infectious, yet they never let us forget the challenges their lives offer.","Jul 23, 2015"

TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,CineVue,80,Patrick Gamble,"Poetic realism for a digital age, Tangerine also shares a lot of qualities with the cinema of Mike Leigh and Ken Loach. There's no cheap manipulation here and Baker's characters never come across as victims.","Nov 15, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Austin Chronicle,78,Steve Davis,"Tangerine’s greatest accomplishment, however, lies with director Baker, who filmed the movie using an iPhone 5S. It’s an amazing achievement – the fluidity of the camerawork is exhilarating at times, the intimacy of the close-ups sometimes unsettling.","Jul 22, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Slant Magazine,75,Ed Gonzalez,"Its triumph is primarily a matter of style, a visionary revelation every bit as expressionistic as its main character's electric sense of shade.","Jun 28, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Movie Nation,75,Roger Moore,"A feisty, funny, down-and-dirty farce as nasty as a Supreme Court dissent, as timely as a Jenner magazine cover.","Jul 7, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,TheWrap,75,Inkoo Kang,"The film bustles along through a series of reveals – a storytelling technique that can lose an audience’s sympathy or suspension of disbelief pretty fast, but which works flawlessly here because the filmmakers and the performers know exactly who their characters are and what kind of world they live in.","Jul 9, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,RogerEbert.com,75,Matt Zoller Seitz,"As written by Sean Baker and Chris Bergoch and directed by Baker, it's assured and immensely likable, and truly independent in story and style.","Jul 10, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Washington Post,75,Ann Hornaday,"As one character observes in Tangerine, Los Angeles is “a beautifully wrapped lie.” Baker has created a fitting homage to artifice and the often tawdry, tender realities that lie beneath.","Jul 16, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,St. Louis Post-Dispatch,75,Calvin Wilson,"Although the story of Sin-Dee and Alexandra might have benefited from a bit more structure, it’s a window into a world of which many people are unaware — but a world that has its share of dreamers.","Aug 6, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,The New Yorker,70,Richard Brody,"Baker revels in the power of clichés and the generic energy of his low-fi cinematography, which is done with a cell phone. The results are picturesque and anecdotal.","Jul 7, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Boston Globe,63,Peter Keough,Subtlety and irony are not among the film’s virtues.,"Jul 16, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,New York Daily News,60,Jordan Hoffman,"Tangerine offers a warts-and-all depiction of a subculture seldom treated with respect by straight society. The movie handles it in a sincere way that’s entertaining, too.","Jul 9, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,New Orleans Times-Picayune,40,Mike Scott,"Like the rest of the film, it's has its laughs and it has its emotion, just not enough of either.","Sep 18, 2015"
TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Time Out,100,Keith Uhlich,"Nichols has said that the idea for the film emerged from a free-floating anxiety that he sensed in the world at large, the feeling that everything we treasure in life could be lost in an instant. That sensation permeates this strikingly original movie - especially its enigmatic mind-fuck of a finale, which will haunt you for several lifetimes.","Sep 27, 2011"
TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,IndieWire,100,Eric Kohn,"As with ""Shotgun Stories,""  Nichols assembles a tense portrait of blue-collar life, while deepening his thematic interests and working on a bigger scale.

TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Philadelphia Inquirer,100,Steven Rea,"Take Shelter, which, it should be said, boasts haunting but seamless visual effects, is a movie for this moment in time, this moment in our lives.","Oct 20, 2011"
TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Tampa Bay Times,100,Steve Persall,"Shannon is perfectly cast, a creepily magnetic actor with an otherworldly calm, tight jaw and piercing, set-apart eyes. The performance and movie stick with you, with masterful construction and muted psychological horror.","Aug 2, 2017"

TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Village Voice,90,Melissa Anderson,"Despite a few missteps, Take Shelter powerfully lays bare our national anxiety disorder - a pervasive dread that Curtis can define only as ""something that's not right.""","Sep 27, 2011"
TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Wall Street Journal,90,Joe Morgenstern,"A dazzling piece of filmmaking, and much of the dazzle - as well as the anguished darkness - comes from Adam Stone's cinematography, which expresses the swirling state of Curtis's mind with richly varied flavors of light.","Sep 29, 2011"
TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Salon,90,Andrew O'Hehir,"A terrifically crafted little movie that bounces off current events and the nation's downbeat mood ingeniously, and that it variously suggests comparisons with the early work of Terrence Malick, Stanley Kubrick and the Coen brothers. Yeah, I think it's that good, but please note that I also said ""little.""","Sep 29, 2011"
TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Chicago Reader,90,J.R.

TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Boston Globe,88,Ty Burr,"Take Shelter plays Curtis's unraveling at daring length. The film will be too slow and dark for some, and it's definitely overlong.","Oct 20, 2011"

TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,The A.V. Club,83,Noel Murray,"Writer-director Jeff Nichols re-teams with his ""Shotgun Stories"" star Michael Shannon for his second feature, Take Shelter, which has a similar setting, but a different mood. Nichols is still concerned with family legacies, and the ways people in smaller communities relate to each other, but Take Shelter is slower and smoother, deliberately developing a mood of creeping dread.","Sep 28, 2011"
TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Variety,80,Justin Chang,"This deliberately paced psychological drama builds an ever-tightening knot of tension around an excellent Michael Shannon, here playing a family man slowly driven mad by apocalyptic visions that could be paranoid, prophetic or both.","Sep 25, 2011"
TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Los Angeles Times,80,Sheri Linden,"From the first moments of the eerie storm that opens the story, dread is the prevailing mood of this pre-apocalyptic drama - a film very much about this moment in time.","Sep 29, 2011"
TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,The New York Times,80,A.O.

TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,New York Daily News,80,Elizabeth Weitzman,"Nichols approaches his subject with thoughtful empathy, and while his themes are enormous - he's addressing no less than the state of our nation - he wisely underplays even the most important moments.","Sep 30, 2011"

TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Austin Chronicle,78,Marjorie Baumgarten,"Take Shelter is a deeply unsettling movie.

TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Slant Magazine,75,Bill Weber,"It's not easy to give a character study concerning mental illness the aspect of

TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,New York Post,63,Lou Lumenick,It would be possible to appreciate Shannon's fabulous work in Take Shelter far better if the filmmaker lost a quarter of the two-hour running time -- there are many overlong scenes that make this a needlessly tough sit.,"Sep 30, 2011"
TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,San Francisco Chronicle,50,Mick LaSalle,"Take Shelter has a problem, the simplest of all problems but no less serious for its being simple. It's a film without suspense and with a slow-moving story that unfolds without surprise or embellishment.","Oct 6, 2011"

UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,2024,Matthew Rankin,Original-Cin,100,Liam Lacey,"In short, Universal Language is something of bag of mixed nuts, a Frankenfilm, a cinematic turducken, with comic non-sequiturs and sight gags linked by three narrative strands.","Feb 6, 2025"

UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,2024,Matthew Rankin,Rolling Stone,100,David Fear,"There is no single category that you can slot Rankin’s mix of a wink, a nudge and an embrace into, so we guess “lo-fi masterpiece” will have to do until a better option comes along.","Feb 14, 2025"

UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,2024,Matthew Rankin,Collider,90,Jason Gorber,"The story navigates the fine line between community pride and nationalistic zeal, providing lessons for a future while admitting to the existential futility of it all. We can shift our perspective, but every time we do, things stay pretty much the same.","Sep 17, 2024"
UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,2024,Matthew Rankin,The New York Times,90,Alissa Wilkinson,"It’s a pensive meditation in an era of displacement, even if the film never tries to make a big point.

UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,2024,Matthew Rankin,The Associated Press,88,Jake Coyle,"Rankin’s film, his second following the also surreal “Twentieth Century” (2019), is propelled less by narrative thrust than the abiding oddity of its basic construction, and the movie’s slavish devotion to seeing it through without a wink.","Feb 18, 2025"
UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,2024,Matthew Rankin,IndieWire,83,David Ehrlich,"Universal Language is first and foremost a testament to the shared artifice of all filmic storytelling, and to the singular realities it’s able to bring alive in turn.","May 25, 2024"
UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,2024,Matthew Rankin,The Daily Beast,83,Nick Schager,An off-kilter creation that feels like the wacko offspring of Aki Kaurismäki and Abbas Kiarostami’s cinemas.,"Oct 9, 2024"
UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,2024,Matthew Rankin,The A.V. Club,83,Jacob Oller,"To further dig into Rankin’s blending of the goofily left-field and the openly earnest, the message persisting through the dry punchlines is that to care for your neighbor, to care for all the oddities of home, is to care for yourself.","Feb 12, 2025"
UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,2024,Matthew Rankin,Variety,80,Peter Debruge,"Rankin may have conceived Universal Language in the spirit of homage, but there’s something undeniably original about the end result.

UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,2024,Matthew Rankin,The Hollywood Reporter,80,Jordan Mintzer,"Rankin seems to be seeking out the universal language of cinema itself.

UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,2024,Matthew Rankin,Los Angeles Times,80,Amy Nicholson,"The tone is dry and spartan — and funny, too, if you don’t mind snorting at someone whose sons died in a marshmallow-eating competition, or giggling over the sobs of a worker weeping in a cubicle for reasons that go unexplained.","Feb 14, 2025"
UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,2024,Matthew Rankin,The Film Verdict,75,Stephen Dalton,"Blending autobiographical elements with heartfelt homages to Iranian cinema, writer-director Matthew Rankin's charmingly surreal comic fable reimagines Canada as a Farsi-speaking dreamland.","May 25, 2024"
UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,2024,Matthew Rankin,Slant Magazine,75,David Robb,"Though juxtaposing Canada’s drabness and relative lack of heritage with Iran’s millennia of unbroken tradition brings out the former aspects particularly clearly, Universal Language is aiming beyond mere satire or culture-clash playfulness.","Sep 8, 2024"

UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,2024,Matthew Rankin,The New Yorker,70,Justin Chang,"[Rankin’s] film, at its best when it expresses a sincere belief in the possibilities of human connection, can feel trapped in the margins of its conceit, short-circuited by movie love.","Feb 13, 2025"
UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,2024,Matthew Rankin,Screen Daily,60,Fionnuala Halligan,You could call it whimsical. Absurdist. Contrived. Or an unexpectedly unusual concept album that doesn’t quite come off but was worth the effort. And you would be correct every time.,"May 25, 2024"
UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,2024,Matthew Rankin,Wall Street Journal,50,Kyle Smith,"The oblique nature of the final act might perhaps be justified if the rest of the movie were better.
