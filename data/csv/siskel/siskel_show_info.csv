WRITTEN ON THE WIND,1956,Douglas Sirk,99,Summer Camp,,USA,In English | Format: Digital,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//written-wind,WRITTEN ON THE WIND,"Douglas Sirk’s WRITTEN ON THE WIND, his most melodramatic domestic tragedy, was a box office smash, and is still considered a Technicolor masterpiece, as well as a camp classic. Lauren Bacall stars alongside Rock Hudson, Robert Stack, and Dorothy Malone (in a deliciously vicious, Academy Award–winning performance) in this saga of a rich Texas oil family caught in a spiral of sex, jealousy, and lots of booze. Opulently designed (The Village Voice’s J.Hoberman said the film has a “lurid classical grandeur that suggests Norman Rockwell redecorating Versailles”), WRITTEN ON THE WIND is serious, perverse, and seriously perverse.",,

Much ink was spilled about on-set drama, with gossip rags declaring that Davis and Crawford despised each other—is BABY JANE camp because of the alleged feud? If it was real, and these women were out for blood, then what a campy show indeed, but if you ignore the lore, Davis and Crawford’s performances, while not subtle, are sensational.",,

M*A*S*H,1970,Robert Altman,116,Robert Altman Centennial,35mm,USA,"In English and Japanese, Korean, and Latin with English subtitles | Format: 35mm",https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//mash,M*A*S*H,"Altman’s irreverent comedy about a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital marked a major breakthrough for his career. Released during the Vietnam War but set during the Korean War (20th Century Fox insisted Korea be referenced in the opening sequence for fear the film would reinforce anti-Vietnam War sentiment) M*A*S*H’s medics, led by surgeons ""Hawkeye"" (Donald Sutherland) and ""Duke"" (Tom Skerritt), mere miles from the front lines, use bawdy pranks to cope with the horrors of combat. A sharp commentary on the absurdity of war wrapped in a blue comedy, M*A*S*H suggests that instead of crying, you might as well laugh. M*A*S*H was in production simultaneously with Fox’s PATTON and TORA! TORA! TORA! “Those were big-budget pictures, and we were cheap,” Altman said. “I knew that if I stayed under budget and didn't cause too much trouble, we could sneak it through."" M*A*S*H won the Palme d’Or at Cannes, garnered five Academy Award nominations, including Altman’s first for Best Director, and became the third highest-grossing film of 1970.",,
GREY GARDENS,1975,"David Maysles, Albert Maysles, Ellen Hovde, Muffie Meyer",95,Summer Camp,,USA,In English | Format: Digital,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//grey-gardens,GREY GARDENS,"In Slate, J. Bryan Lowder wrote what makes the documentary GREY GARDENS in part a camp classic, and “one of the most prominent and oft-cited entries in the canon of gay culture,” is that Big Edie and Little Edie Beale, the reclusive cousins of Jackie Onassis, are intimately captured, in their deteriorating house in East Hampton, without an ounce of judgement. “The filmmakers simply allow them to be,” Lowder writes. That uninhibited freedom is, as Sontag writes, a hallmark of camp: “a proper mixture of the exaggerated, the fantastic, the passionate and the naive.”",,
FEMALE TROUBLE,1974,John Waters,89,Summer Camp,35mm,USA,In English | Format: 35mm,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//female-trouble,FEMALE TROUBLE,"This series would be incomplete without a film from John Waters, the “King of Camp,” who lives and breathes artifice and lives exaggeration. In FEMALE TROUBLE, Divine stars as Dawn Davenport, a runaway who goes on a nightmarish journey defined by abuse, petty crime, cosmetology, and fame. Waters, aka the “Pope of Trash,” finds extravagance in the filth, which he embraces with all the seriousness camp requires. As Sontag writes, “Camp taste is a kind of love for human nature. It relishes, rather than judges.”",,

The film’s solemnity set against gaudy Las Vegas, Berkley’s extreme performance, the backstage melodrama of the Stardust Resort and Casino has enshrined SHOWGIRLS as camp canon. Content consideration: contains a scene of sexual assault.",,

Released as a drama, when audiences responded to the film with laughter, Paramount resold MOMMIE DEAREST as a comedy (new posters read “Meet the biggest mother of them all!”). The film and Dunaway’s explosive performance was lambasted—Variety mocked, “Dunaway does not chew scenery, she swallows it whole, costars and all."" Dunaway’s theatricality has been exhaustively parodied, tributed, and embraced—44 years later we’re still shrieking, “No wire hangers!”",,
BREWSTER MCCLOUD,1970,Robert Altman,105,Robert Altman Centennial,35mm,USA,In English | Format: 35mm,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//brewster-mccloud,BREWSTER MCCLOUD,"Fresh off the success of M*A*S*H, Altman founded his own production company, Lion’s Gate Films, to give himself creative freedom, delivering a quirky story about Brewster (Bud Cort), an owlish teenager who lives in the basement of the Houston Astrodome, working daily on a pair of wings that he hopes will allow him to fly. After a series of villainous Houstonians are strangled—and continuously shat on by birds—and Brewster is pegged as the suspect, alongside Astrodome tour guide Suzanne (Shelley Duvall, in her debut performance), taking to the sky may be Brewster’s only chance of escape. “I wouldn't say it's my best film,” Altman admitted. “It's flawed, not nearly as finished as some work I've done since, but it's my favorite, because I took more chances then. It was my boldest work, by far my most ambitious. I went way out on a limb to reach for it.”",,
BOOM!,1968,Joseph Losey,110,Summer Camp,,UK,In English and Italian with English subtitles | Format: Digital,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//boom,BOOM!,"In the riotous BOOM!, the terminally-ill Flora Goforth (Elizabeth Taylor) is visited at her Capri villa by the mysterious Chris Flanders (Richard Burton) who may be the angel of death. Adapted from a Tennessee Williams play, director John Waters, the film’s biggest fan, calls BOOM!, “The other side of camp. It's beautiful, atrocious, and it's perfect.” The production went wildly over budget, in part due to Taylor’s extravagant costumes, which includes a two-foot tall beaded headdress. Sontag wrote, “Camp is a woman walking around in a dress made of three million feathers.” Instead of feathers, BOOM! went with beads.",,
42ND STREET,1933,Lloyd Bacom,89,Summer Camp,,USA,In English | Format: Digital,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//42nd-street,42ND STREET,"The Busby Berkeley–choreographed, smash hit musical 42ND STREET may seem misplaced on this list (even blasphemously so, alongside SHOWGIRLS) but in “Notes on Camp,” Sontag singles out the film. “The pure examples of camp are unintentional; they are dead serious. Genuine camp does not mean to be funny.” 42ND STREET, a dazzling backstage story about a Broadway director who mounts one last show before he retires, is steeped in camp sensibility: extravagant production design, sincere melodrama, and earnest spectacle—Berkeley’s calling card.",,
KING KONG,1933,"Merian C. Cooper, Ernest B. Schoedsack",100,Summer Camp,,USA,In English | Format: Digital,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//king-kong,KING KONG,"In “Notes on Camp,” Sontag provides examples of canonical camp: The National Enquirer, Swan Lake, Flash Gordon comics, and KING KONG. When it was released, there wasn’t a whiff of camp to KING KONG, and audiences marveled at and took seriously its originality. While Sontag writes that time can make the banal fantastic, with KONG, the opposite occurs: Kong’s T-Rex fight on Skull Island, Fay Wray squirming in his massive paw, the ape beating his chest on the top of the Empire State Building—it all reads quite campy now. Still, the final line of the film, which we won’t dare spoil here, is one of the best of the last century.",,
MCCABE & MRS. MILLER,1971,Robert Altman,120,Robert Altman Centennial,35mm,USA,In English and Cantonese with English subtitles | Format: 35mm,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//mccabe-mrs-miller,MCCABE & MRS. MILLER,"Altman’s revisionist Western stars Warren Beaty as gambler John McCabe and Julie Christie as madam Constance Miller, two newcomers to the town of Presbyterian Church, Washington, in the early 1900s. After they partner up to run a saloon and brothel, their business is threatened by a corporation interested in buying the property. Altman’s layered dialogue style and unorthodox, fluid cinematography radically upended the Western genre. The stakes are high, of course—prosperity, love, death—but here Altman swaps the dusty frontier for the muddy and snowy Pacific Northwest, and trades American patriotism for melancholic isolation. Set to the songs of Leonard Cohen, the film earned Julie Christie an Academy Award nomination and was praised by The New Yorker’s Pauline Kael as being so affecting “it leaves one rather dazed.” Of its director, The Chicago Tribune’s Gene Siskel declared, “Altman is clearly a master.” 35mm print courtesy The Chicago Film Society.",,

Founder of Lab/ Shul, the “god-optional, pop-up, experimental Jewish community,” Lau-Lavie shocks everyone when he decides to become a rabbi himself, studying in the conservative tradition of Judaism so he has the knowledge to challenge the canon from within. Provocative and engaging, SABBATH QUEEN is an exhilarating document of freedom, faith, independence, and individuality. Dialogue: Director Sandi Simcha Dubowski in attendance.",,

In this, their last film together, Dietrich is the notorious seductress Concha to Cesar Romero’s Captain Costelar, who, falling under the temptresses spell, is warned to resist her charms. A veritable feast of baroque décor and opulence, Dietrich’s wardrobe—replete with gowns, massive jewels, and unforgettable hats—is worth the price of admission alone.",,
IMAGES,1972,Robert Altman,104,Robert Altman Centennial,,UK,In English and French with English subtitles | Format: Digital,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//images,IMAGES,"In Altman’s psychological thriller, the mental undoing of author Cathryn (Susannah York) begins with disturbing phone calls that suggest her husband Hugh is having an affair. Shortly after, Cathryn is plagued by visions of her dead lover Rene, and receives an unexpected visit by her ex-lover Marcel—and soon is unable to distinguish the three men from one another. Critical viewing for Altman devotees and novices alike, IMAGES, which critics compared to Ingmar Bergman’s PERSONA (a major inspiration for the film), is an atypical Altman film, with a small cast of five, no overlapping dialogue, and haunting visuals that marked an entirely new style in his filmography (which he revisits in 1977’s 3 WOMEN, presented in this series July 16 and 19). IMAGES premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, where York won the Best Actress prize. A young John Williams received an Academy Award nomination for his chilling original score.",,
LIGHTNING,1952,Mikio Naruse,87,,35mm,Japan,In Japanese with English subtitles | Format: Imported 35mm,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//lightning,Chicago Film Society Presents: LIGHTNING,"You've never met a more cheerful urban ambassador than Kiyoko (Hideko Takamine), who works as a tour guide on a bus and spends her days airily comparing the sights and sounds of post-war Tokyo to the old world charms of Paris. From the first moment she’s glimpsed on screen, Kiyoko is obviously living her best life, unencumbered by marriage, children, or professional anxiety—and yet everyone in her family wonders when she’s going to settle down with the right man. Her mother, who’s been married and divorced four times and had a child with each husband, suggests (and suggests and suggests again) the local baker as a suitor with squarely good- enough appeal. Both of Kiyoko’s sisters attest to the pleasures of coupledom, despite much evidence to the contrary. Kiyoko laughs it all off, breezily informing any interlocutor that men are just terrible. (Luckily, she can readily cite the example of her ne’er-do-well brother, with his slovenly, unshaven legs and his meager pachinko parlor winnings.) Adapted from a novel by Fumiko Hayashi, whose hard- scrabble, lower-middle class milieu was brought to the screen six times by Mikio Naruse, LIGHTNING is an unassuming marvel, a work that teeters on the edge of romantic comedy, but never succumbs. Kinema Junpo magazine declared it the second-best Japanese film of 1952, behind only Kurosawa’s IKIRU, but LIGHTNING, along with the rest of Naruse’s post-war output, did not get distributed in the US and remains undeservedly obscure. Like its heroine, LIGHTNING simply engages with the world, avoids shunting its characters into readymade boxes, and looks over the horizon for fleeting release. (Chicago Film Society) 35mm from the Japan Foundation, permission Kadokawa.",,

Shortly after, Cathryn is plagued by visions of her dead lover Rene, and receives an unexpected visit by her ex-lover Marcel—and soon is unable to distinguish the three men from one another. Critical viewing for Altman devotees and novices alike, IMAGES, which critics compared to Ingmar Bergman’s PERSONA (a major inspiration for the film), is an atypical Altman film, with a small cast of five, no overlapping dialogue, and haunting visuals that marked an entirely new style in his filmography (which he revisits in 1977’s 3 WOMEN, presented in this series July 16 and 19).

LIGHTNING,1952,Mikio Naruse,87,,35mm,Japan,In Japanese with English subtitles | Format: Imported 35mm,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//lightning,Chicago Film Society Presents: LIGHTNING,"You've never met a more cheerful urban ambassador than Kiyoko (Hideko Takamine), who works as a tour guide on a bus and spends her days airily comparing the sights and sounds of post-war Tokyo to the old world charms of Paris. From the first moment she’s glimpsed on screen, Kiyoko is obviously living her best life, unencumbered by marriage, children, or professional anxiety—and yet everyone in her family wonders when she’s going to settle down with the right man. Her mother, who’s been married and divorced four times and had a child with each husband, suggests (and suggests and suggests again) the local baker as a suitor with squarely good- enough appeal. Both of Kiyoko’s sisters attest to the pleasures of coupledom, despite much evidence to the contrary. Kiyoko laughs it all off, breezily informing any interlocutor that men are just terrible. (Luckily, she can readily cite the example of her ne’er-do-well brother, with his slovenly, unshaven legs and his meager pachinko parlor winnings.) Adapted from a novel by Fumiko Hayashi, whose hard- scrabble, lower-middle class milieu was brought to the screen six times by Mikio Naruse, LIGHTNING is an unassuming marvel, a work that teeters on the edge of romantic comedy, but never succumbs. Kinema Junpo magazine declared it the second-best Japanese film of 1952, behind only Kurosawa’s IKIRU, but LIGHTNING, along with the rest of Naruse’s post-war output, did not get distributed in the US and remains undeservedly obscure. Like its heroine, LIGHTNING simply engages with the world, avoids shunting its characters into readymade boxes, and looks over the horizon for fleeting release. (Chicago Film Society) 35mm from the Japan Foundation, permission Kadokawa.",Siskel,2025-06-25T21:23:19.857608+00:00

In FEMALE TROUBLE, Divine stars as Dawn Davenport, a runaway who goes on a nightmarish journey defined by abuse, petty crime, cosmetology, and fame. Waters, aka the “Pope of Trash,” finds extravagance in the filth, which he embraces with all the seriousness camp requires. As Sontag writes, “Camp taste is a kind of love for human nature.

Walsh’s authentic script and Altman’s chaotic style give CALIFORNIA SPLIT a manic energy—the poker tables and racetracks come alive with the possibility of a win and the looming threat of loss, and Gould and Segal deliver raw performances in a film that is as much about gambling as it is about their relationship. CALIFORNIA SPLIT recorded eight separate audio channels simultaneously, which allowed Altman to further develop his trademark dialogue style, and gives the film a richer sense of place: every inch of the casino floor hums. One of the 13 films Altman made in the 1970s, CALIFORNIA SPLIT remains a standout in his filmography—an unsentimental look at addiction, and a bittersweet portrait of friendship.",Siskel,2025-06-25T21:23:19.857608+00:00

Altman made a deal with the stage producer to retain the original cast (Karen Black, Cher, Sandy Dennis, Kathy Bates) and the set, which included two-way mirrors, and allowed the camera to transition from present to past as the women recall the last two decades of their lives.

As Ned falls hard for Matty, she tells him about her unhappy marriage to her wealthy husband, and the two hatch a plot to murder him and claim his fortune. Blinded by lust, Ned begins to realize that he’s one step behind what he thought was a perfect crime. Set against a sweltering Florida summer, Lawrence Kasdan’s BODY HEAT is a classic erotic drama of the 1980s (even if it was set in winter, Hurt and Turner’s chemistry would be red hot), and an homage to film noir, replete with a jazzy score and a barn-burner of a twist ending.",Siskel,2025-07-16T16:10:47.721576+00:00

Reilly), and the show’s host, GK (Garrison Keillor, creator of the public radio show of the same name) are visited by a ghost (Virginia Madsen), as they reminisce about the good old days and prepare to go on air. Altman was 80 during production-—Paul Thomas Anderson was hired as a backup director to appease studio concern regarding Altman’s health-—and he passed away just months after the film was released. A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION fittingly serves as a farewell from Altman: a tribute to the enduring power of storytelling, and a bittersweet ode to goodbyes.

The first film in Kiarostami’s wonderous Koker Trilogy (followed by AND LIFE GOES ON and THROUGH THE OLIVE TREES), WHERE IS THE FRIEND’S HOUSE? is a delicate and divine fable of altruism, friendship, and kindness, and a gentle reminder that even the smallest of gestures can have an enormous impact.

Elusive, prescient, and exquisitely made, this trenchant exploration of the plight of refugees feels even more timely than when it first premiered. After a fascist invasion of France, Georg (PASSAGES’ Franz Rogowski) assumes the identity of a dead author in order to flee to Mexico. As he waits for passage, he becomes trapped in the port city of Marseilles in the company of others desperate to escape.

We meet 23 of them—portrayed by Matthew Modine, Julianne Moore, Fred Ward, Anne Archer, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Robert Downey Jr., Lili Taylor, Madeleine Stowe, Chris Penn, Jack Lemmon, Frances McDormand, Tim Robbins, Lori Singer, Peter Gallagher, Andie MacDowell, Buck Henry, Zane Cassidy, Lily Tomlin, Annie Ross, Bruce Davidson, Huey Lewis, Lyle Lovett, and Tom Waits—whose lives intersect over the course of a weekend. Adapted from the stories of Raymond Carver, SHORT CUTS is a grand vision that, like Los Angeles, sprawls: across marriages, sex, death, and hope. Epic in scale but abundant with moments of intimacy, SHORT CUTS, for which Altman received his fourth Academy Award nomination for Best Director, is an unforgettable portrait of the beauty and chaos of everyday life. 35mm print courtesy of the Robert Altman Collection at the UCLA Film & Television Archive.",Siskel,2025-07-19T03:20:04.187209+00:00

As Tuco knows the cemetery location, and the drifter knows which grave holds the cache, the two set out across war zones to find and share the reward. Meanwhile, the criminal Setenza (Lee Van Cleef) is on his own hunt for the cash and will do anything to claim it for himself. Sergio Leone’s operatic masterpiece, set to Ennio Morricone’s iconic score, dismantles audiences ideas of the romantic western; this is an unforgiving landscape where there is no John Wayne coming to save the day, and even if you survive the final standoff (and what a standoff it is!), you don’t ride off into the sunset, but under a blazingly hot sun.",Siskel,2025-07-19T03:20:04.187209+00:00

Happily retired, Gal and his wife’s languid life is shattered by the arrival of the psychotic gangster Don Logan (Ben Kingsley, in an electrifying, Academy Award–nominated performance), who is intent on persuading Gal to do one more big job. Reticent to return to a life of crime, Gal is given little choice to refuse Don without dire consequences. A slick and stylish crime caper, SEXY BEAST is also a red hot thriller that threatens to boil over at any minute.

When Tennessee teacher Bertram Cates is put on trial for teaching evolution instead of creationism, he is defended in a sweltering courtroom by Chicago lawyer and atheist Henry Drummond (Spencer Tracy), against a prosecution team that includes Biblical scholar and zealot Matthew Brady (Fredric March). As the public gallery fans themselves (“I’ll pack my bags and go back to Chicago where it’s a nice, cool 100 degrees in the shade,” Drummond quips), a masterful verbal sparring match about ignorance fueled by religious righteousness plays out. Capturing it all is reporter E.K Hornbeck (Gene Kelly), adding to the feeling that, if it weren’t for the suspenders and the lack of air conditioning, INHERIT THE WIND could be a 2025 new release coming to a theater near you.",Siskel,2025-07-19T03:20:04.187209+00:00

When their friend Harry (Maurice Ronet) and his daughter Penelope (Jane Birkin) come to visit, old rivalries return and new attractions spark, and the once placid and pleasurable summer becomes a turbulent and tense reunion. In addition to the scorching sun, Delon and Schneider, once a couple in real life (so beautiful a pair, they were nicknamed “the magnificent lovers”) saturate the film with their white hot, crackling chemistry.

Luke refuses to conform to the prison’s authoritarian leadership, which makes him a target of the warden and rifleman, and his defiance puts him at odds with top dog prisoner Dragline (George Kennedy, in an Academy Award–winning performance), until a sweat-soaked, knock- down, drag-out fight between the two earns Luke Dragline’s admiration and respect. Tenacious and resilient, Luke challenges the boundaries of what is expected of him as a prisoner and fellow inmate, turning him into a symbol of resistance against oppressive authority, and a hero within the gang. Shirts stick to sweaty backs and the unrelenting heat and abuse weighs heavily on the captive men, even the seemingly unbreakable Cool Hand Luke, in this classic and devastating story of hope and heroes.",Siskel,2025-07-19T03:20:04.187209+00:00

In her fourth feature, Reichardt’s pensive spin on the heist genre revolves around three radical eco-activists (played by Jesse Eisenberg, Dakota Fanning, and Peter Sarsgaard), who conspire to blow up a dam. Boasting a showstopping, nerve-racking centerpiece, the film is a probing look at the psychological consequences of political action and the tensions between peaceful personal ideology and violent, declarative protest.",Siskel,2025-07-19T03:20:04.187209+00:00

Julian Fellows’ (later of Downton Abbey fame) delicious dissection of the British class structure is brought to lavish life in Altman’s late career whodunit. Set in 1930s England, a group of aristocrats (Kristin Scott Thomas, Michael Gambon, Tom Hollander, Maggie Smith) gather at a grand estate for a weekend of hunting, as their maids, butlers, and valets (Hellen Mirren, Clive Owen, Kelly Macdonald, Emily Watson) assemble to serve them. Simmering tensions, clandestine conversations, and multi-course dinners are disrupted when a member of the ruling class is murdered (twice!), and everyone—both upstairs and down—is a suspect. Garnering Altman his fifth Best Director Academy Award nomination, a nomination for Best Picture, and a Best Original Screenplay win for Fellows (as well as Best Supporting Actress noms for both Smith and Mirren), GOSFORD PARK proved that no one can do “Altmanesque” better than Altman.",Siskel,2025-07-19T03:20:04.187209+00:00

THE BIRDS spares no child, adult, updo, or body part from the feathered freaks raining down from the sky.

Gregory Peck was cast as a kidnapped hieroglyphics expert with Sophia Loren as the woman who helps him escape certain death; their enthusiasm for the project carried the film into production, despite Donen’s growing distaste for its script. Rather than attempt to rein in its jumbled intrigues and inscrutable motivations, Donen opted to focus on the film’s visual design, bringing a dazzling and experimental flamboyance to action set pieces (including a bonkers LSD-addled bicycle chase and a deadly showdown during an optometry appointment) and otherwise-rote exposition alike.

Alan J. Pakula’s second collaboration with legendary lensman Gordon Willis (KLUTE, THE GODFATHER) wedded the burgeoning genre of “American political thriller” to a severe, Antonioni-ish sense of scale, composition, and color—Beatty and other puny humans are frequently dwarfed by pale, unfeeling cityscapes and gargantuan modernist architecture in vibrant primary hues. Among the film’s other monuments: a small, stirring performance from the great Paula Prentiss that serves as the story’s emotional linchpin. (Gabriel Wallace)",Siskel,2025-07-19T03:20:04.187209+00:00

What more do you need to know? Frank Tashlin, directing the Maestro for the eighth and final time, delivers a blistering cavalcade of visual gags, aural puns, and hospital slapstick, with his signature cartoon-bred flourishes that (arguably) propel Lewis’s manic schticking to the level of High American Pop. The film occasionally explodes with garish chromatic touches as though it’s moonlighting as a test film for the Technicolor process itself. We must also single out for praise the title song, surely one of filmdom’s most bizarre, which is hauntingly crooned over the opening credits by Sammy Davis, Jr. Don’t find a gag funny?

Beloved for its beautiful Sherman Brothers songs, the incredible performances of Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke, and its 14-minute chimney sweep dance sequence, MARY POPPINS may also be more timely than ever, a film which advocates for charity, humility, laughter, and common sense in a world which increasingly lacks all of these things.

A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION fittingly serves as a farewell from Altman: a tribute to the enduring power of storytelling, and a bittersweet ode to goodbyes.
