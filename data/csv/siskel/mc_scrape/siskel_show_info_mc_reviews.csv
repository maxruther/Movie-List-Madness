ERIC LARUE,2024,Michael Shannon,The Hollywood Reporter,80,David Rooney,"There’s no escaping the fact that Eric Larue is a downer, but it’s a work of thoughtful intelligence and restraint, elegantly shot and graced by a striking score from Jonathan Mastro full of dissonant strings that often evoke a sense of nerves about to shatter. Most of all, it’s beautifully acted.","Mar 25, 2025"
ERIC LARUE,2024,Michael Shannon,IndieWire,75,Samantha Bergeson,"Playwright and frequent Shannon collaborator Neveu adapted his own play for the screen, and Shannon’s sensitive direction makes Eric LaRue a haunting, standout film with a career-best performance from Greer.","Jun 12, 2023"
ERIC LARUE,2024,Michael Shannon,Screen Rant,70,Patrice Witherspoon,Shannon and Neveu’s compassionate display of understanding different perspectives when it comes to something as tragic as a school shooting is simply beautiful storytelling.,"Jun 22, 2023"
ERIC LARUE,2024,Michael Shannon,The Playlist,67,Marshall Shaffer,"Shannon’s first feature might begin to sag under the weight of this stilted dialogue and stunted duration, but there is still a lot to admire in Eric Larue. Those qualities are not necessarily all concentrated in Judy Greer, either. Even if the film moves in circles, at least it’s circling something honest and true about spirituality and society alike.","Jun 12, 2023"
ERIC LARUE,2024,Michael Shannon,LarsenOnFilm,63,Josh Larsen,"At its best, Eric LaRue interrogates the rush to healing and forgiveness that can sometimes follow tragedy in Christian communities.","Apr 2, 2025"
ERIC LARUE,2024,Michael Shannon,The A.V. Club,58,Brianna Zigler,"Though carried by a subtle and strenuous performance from Greer, Eric LaRue‘s intentionally unanswered questions do less to provoke than render the film a collage of well-meaning, half-finished sentiments.","Apr 2, 2025"
ERIC LARUE,2024,Michael Shannon,Collider,50,Taylor Gates,"There are several interesting ideas and stories floating around Eric LaRue, but Shannon can’t seem to decide which ones to focus on. While there are some genuinely fantastic, inspired moments, they frustratingly never quite come together, leading to a baffling viewing experience. Hopefully, Greer will get another chance in the spotlight of a more worthy film.","Jun 15, 2023"
ERIC LARUE,2024,Michael Shannon,Slant Magazine,50,Pat Brown,"While the film features a strong performance from Judy Greer, it’s essentially a patchwork of broad strokes that rarely feel like they’re bringing its world to credible life.","Apr 1, 2025"
MISERICORDIA,2024,Alain Guiraudie,The Playlist,100,Ankit Jhunjhunwala,"This is rigorous filmmaking of the highest order, controlled and precise to the exclusion of anything extraneous —evidenced by its taut 100-minute runtime.","May 27, 2024"
MISERICORDIA,2024,Alain Guiraudie,The Globe and Mail (Toronto),100,Saffron Maeve,"With Misericordia, Guiraudie deftly strikes the balance between the playfully sacrilegious and the sociopathic, rounded out by a seductively bizarre cast of dwellers and clusters of puckered, corpse-fed mushrooms.","Mar 26, 2025"
MISERICORDIA,2024,Alain Guiraudie,The Film Stage,91,Leonardo Goi,"For all its morbid undertones and philosophical ruminations, Misericordia is neither a dirge nor a lofty symposium. Strange as it may be to say for a story that begins with a burial and then shatters after a heinous death, this is a supremely and surprisingly funny film, where humor gradually accrues a subversiveness not unlike desire’s own.","May 27, 2024"

MISERICORDIA,2024,Alain Guiraudie,The New York Times,90,Wesley Morris,"Misericordia is film noir with the lights turned on. Even when its characters are working your nerves, it tickles. Guiraudie is playing those nerves like a harp.","Mar 20, 2025"
MISERICORDIA,2024,Alain Guiraudie,The Daily Beast,88,Nick Schager,"A superb thriller that employs common genre devices for a canny and caustic rumination on right and wrong, love and lust, virtue and vice.","Mar 18, 2025"
MISERICORDIA,2024,Alain Guiraudie,RogerEbert.com,88,Simon Abrams,"It’s not a hard movie to follow or fall for, as fans of Guiraudie’s earlier movies already know. He commands our attention even when his characters are either too ridiculous or too petty to be taken seriously.","Mar 21, 2025"
MISERICORDIA,2024,Alain Guiraudie,Screen Daily,80,Jonathan Romney,"This might suggest that Misericordia is ultimately a film with a message, and a more solemn one than we’re used to with Guiraudie. But any apparent clarity should be taken with a pinch of salt, the film’s meanings shifting as constantly as the erotic drives between the various male (and occasionally female) characters.","May 27, 2024"

MISERICORDIA,2024,Alain Guiraudie,Los Angeles Times,80,Joshua Rothkopf,"This isn’t the kind of puzzle thriller in which all the elements click into place with a thudding literalism that compliments an attentive eye. It’s one that accommodates the vagaries of human behavior, leaving punishment aside as a secondary concern.","Mar 21, 2025"

MISERICORDIA,2024,Alain Guiraudie,The Irish Times,80,Tara Brady,"The director of Stranger by the Lake returns to the deadpan, sexually unstable working-class environs that have shaped many of his previous films with this pleasingly confounding tale of displaced characters and desires.","Mar 26, 2025"
MISERICORDIA,2024,Alain Guiraudie,Slant Magazine,75,Brad Hanford,"Misericordia finds Alain Guiraudie revisiting old standbys under a relatively conventional set of aesthetic strategies. Fortunately, the ideas roiling under the former wildman’s newly placid surfaces are as potent as ever.","Sep 10, 2024"
MISERICORDIA,2024,Alain Guiraudie,The A.V. Club,75,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,"While it lacks the surrealistic and fairy-tale elements that distinguish many of Guiraudie’s films (among them Sunshine For The Poor, Time Has Come, and Staying Vertical), Misericordia is nonetheless pervaded by a casual dreaminess and a disregard for the strictures of realism that leads in some (intentionally) silly directions.","Mar 20, 2025"
MISERICORDIA,2024,Alain Guiraudie,Original-Cin,75,Liz Braun,"Moments of brilliance notwithstanding, the comedy and the dark look at human nature in Misericordia never quite meld. For any student of human nature, that unreliable narrator and the gang of unlikeable characters may eventually wear thin.","Mar 25, 2025"
MISERICORDIA,2024,Alain Guiraudie,The Hollywood Reporter,70,Jordan Mintzer,"The two movies don’t always crystallize into one, and if you’re looking for a credible crime thriller in which everyone behaves logically, Misericordia may not be for you. If, on the other hand, you’re looking for an exploration of repressed sexual desire and religious hypocrisy in backwoods France, Guiraudie’s strange and sober new film does the trick.","May 27, 2024"
MISERICORDIA,2024,Alain Guiraudie,Wall Street Journal,70,Zachary Barnes,"By its end, “Misericordia” emerges as a drama by turns chilling and absurd, with some of its twists daring us toward incredulity. Yet Mr. Guiraudie’s mix of mischief-making and straight-faced conviction keeps us continuously unsettled, and continuously curious.","Mar 20, 2025"
MISERICORDIA,2024,Alain Guiraudie,Paste Magazine,68,Jim Vorel,"At times arrestingly suspenseful, at others bitterly funny, but often inert in its transitions, Misericordia is an occasionally confounding mixed bag, but one that stands out for the realistic recriminations of a place where grievances run deep and mercy comes with strings attached.","Mar 21, 2025"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,The New York Times,100,Natalia Winkelman,"Beauty is pleasurable, but the film’s use of evocative visuals to focus on storytelling more broadly is what makes it a quiet knockout.","Mar 27, 2025"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,Los Angeles Times,100,Tim Grierson,"The characters’ dilemma may, ultimately, be meaningless set against the ebbs and flows of history, but Gomes, who won the directing prize at last year’s Cannes Film Festival, invests it with such elegance that it becomes nearly mythic: a touching fable of cowardice and devotion with tragic undertones. The scenes may be dreamlike, but they’re our shared dream of being swept away by the movies.","Mar 28, 2025"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,The Film Stage,91,Rory O'Connor,"It all comes together beautifully, a film to stimulate curious corners of the mind and adventurous parts of the spirit.","May 27, 2024"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,Screen Daily,90,Jonathan Romney,"A hypnotic and inventive Asian odyssey ... The viewer may not know exactly where Gomes and his characters are headed, but the journey is pursued with wit, imagination and intelligence, and delivers oblique insights about the way we see the world and history.","May 22, 2024"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,Variety,90,Jessica Kiang,"But for anyone feeling a pessimism creeping in like slow poison and taking the edge off any appetite for adventure, Portuguese singularity Miguel Gomes comes like a comet across the Cannes competition with “Grand Tour,” an enchanting, enlivening, era-spanning, continent-crossing travelogue that runs the very serious risk of infecting you with the antidote: a potent dose of wanderlust-for-life.","May 22, 2024"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,New York Magazine (Vulture),90,Bilge Ebiri,"The film returns us to a childlike gaze, marveling at a world alive with possibility, where every sight lives on a continuum of meaning.","Oct 10, 2024"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,Slant Magazine,88,Brad Hanford,"If Tabu locates the colonial mindset in madness and obsession, Grand Tour does so in cowardice and obliviousness.","Oct 2, 2024"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,The A.V. Club,83,Alex Lei,"Gomes picks apart an imagined past by experiencing its present, at the same time sharply unpacking the screwball comedy by separating the running man and the pursuing woman.","Mar 26, 2025"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,The Guardian,80,Peter Bradshaw,"It is elegant, eccentric and needs some time to be indulged. ... And yes, it is six parts beguiling to one part exasperating. But ... it leaves you with a gentle, bemused smile on your face.","May 22, 2024"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,The Film Verdict,78,Deborah Young,"Gomes is a director poised between ironic narrative and experimentalism pure and simple, and his films (often described as strange, lyrical and hypnotizing) divide audiences into the visionaries and the unconvinced.","May 23, 2024"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,RogerEbert.com,75,Glenn Kenny,"Viewers looking for a tidy narrative and gratifying conclusions will come up short with this movie. But if you can roll with atmospherics that are their own reason for being, “Grand Tour” has plenty, and they’re all beautifully realized.","Mar 28, 2025"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,TheWrap,70,Chase Hutchinson,"It is a wholly uncompromising experience that dances with mirth and melancholy. Proving to be evocative in one moment and unrelentingly exhausting in the next, it’s as gorgeous to behold visually as it is hard to completely embrace thematically. And yet, if you abandon yourself to it by the end as one character says, you can catch glimpses of something spectacularly sublime in the vast journey that it takes on.","May 27, 2024"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,IndieWire,67,David Ehrlich,"But for all the luminous beauty of its images, ""Grand Tour"" sorely lacks a current strong enough to sustain the thoughts that flow between them, compelling as some of those thoughts may be.","May 22, 2024"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,The Hollywood Reporter,60,Jordan Mintzer,"Fans of Gomes’ breakthrough 2012 feature, Tabu, will find much to love here as well, and in terms of craft his latest offers some truly beguiling moments. But anyone looking for a good story, or characters to get hooked on, may find themselves admiring the scenery without ever relishing it.","May 22, 2024"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,Collider,60,Aidan Kelley,"The film does show that Gomes is capable of making an authentic period piece and a stunning documentary, but the attempt of trying to do both at the same time has led to an unusual experiment that will leave one scratching their head.","Jan 21, 2025"
