TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Screen Daily,100,John Hazelton,Tangerine paints a portrait of transgender sex workers and their clients that pulses with raunchy energy and compassionate humour. It’s a bracing slice of American indie film-making.,"Jul 7, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Los Angeles Times,100,Rebecca Keegan,"With a witty and efficient script by director Sean Baker and co-writer Chris Bergoch, Tangerine peels back the curtain on a fascinating Los Angeles microculture.","Jul 9, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,The New York Times,100,Manohla Dargis,"Tangerine encompasses dizzying multitudes — it’s a neo-screwball chase flick with a dash of Rainer Werner Fassbinder — but mostly, movingly, it is a female-friendship movie about two people who each started life with an XY chromosome set.","Jul 9, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,New York Magazine (Vulture),100,David Edelstein,"What’s extraordinary about Tangerine is that it’s everything an entertaining, old-fashioned, mainstream Hollywood comedy should be but no longer is. That nowadays you have to get this kind of stuff via Sundance from directors using iPhones is a drag — the wrong kind.","Jul 9, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,San Francisco Chronicle,100,David Lewis,"This is sublime filmmaking, a textbook example of how indies can tell groundbreaking stories in a way that Hollywood simply can’t match.","Jul 16, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Slate,100,Dana Stevens,"A sneaky slice-of-life indie that comes on all casual and cinéma-verité in the early scenes, then slowly coalesces into a romantic comedy as intricately constructed as any door-slamming stage farce.","Jul 21, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Time Out,100,David Ehrlich,"A saturated picture that courses with the raw energy of found footage while still feeling artfully composed, a movie that punches with the skittering violence of dubstep but careens through L.A. with the unbridled freedom of bebop jazz.","Jul 21, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Salon,100,Andrew O'Hehir,"This is a gorgeous, timely and possibly profound human comedy, and if there’s no disentangling the medium from the message that’s because both are powerful and ambiguous.","Jul 21, 2015"

TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,The Hollywood Reporter,90,David Rooney,"The film's smart craftsmanship is ultimately less noteworthy than its humanizing, prejudice-challenging immersion into the lives of people who inhabit L.A.'s low-end drug and sex industry.","Jan 31, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Variety,90,Justin Chang,"Writer-director Sean Baker’s sun-scorched, street-level snapshot is a work of rueful, matter-of-fact insight and unapologetically wild humor that draws a motley collection of funny, sad and desperate individuals into its protagonists’ orbit.","Jan 31, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Village Voice,90,Stephanie Zacharek,"In the early minutes you might not be sure what you're watching. Tangerine's a comedy, of course, laced with rambunctious, exuberantly ragged dialogue. But by the end, Baker and his actors have led us to a place beyond comedy — you may still be laughing, but your breath catches a little on the way out.","Jul 7, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,New York Post,88,Sara Stewart,"The two working girls at the center of Tangerine are played by engaging newcomers: Kitana Kiki Rodriguez as the freshly out-of-jail Sin-Dee Rella, and Mya Taylor as her best friend Alexandra.","Jul 8, 2015"

TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Philadelphia Inquirer,88,Steven Rea,"Baker gets great, sly, unforced performances from his two leads, but it's not all a rollicking good time: There are moments of quietude, inquietude, moments when a sense of wariness and loneliness settles over the women.","Jul 24, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,The A.V. Club,83,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,"It’s the movie’s quietest, softest moments that register most strongly, be it Alexandra’s low-key performance of Victor Herbert’s “Toyland” to an almost empty bar, or the final scene, which finds her and Sin-Dee alone in a Laundromat at the end of a long, bad night.","Jul 8, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Portland Oregonian,83,Marc Mohan,"Baker's previous films ""Take Out"" and ""Starlet"" have focused on populations generally treated with disdain by mainstream society -- illegal immigrants and porn performers, respectively.

TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Wall Street Journal,80,Joe Morgenstern,The film is clearly not for everyone; sometimes it wasn’t for me. But it’s steadfastly nonjudgmental and wonderfully tender toward two searchers for new versions of old-fashioned love.,"Jul 9, 2015"

TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,CineVue,80,Patrick Gamble,"Poetic realism for a digital age, Tangerine also shares a lot of qualities with the cinema of Mike Leigh and Ken Loach. There's no cheap manipulation here and Baker's characters never come across as victims.","Nov 15, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Austin Chronicle,78,Steve Davis,"Tangerine’s greatest accomplishment, however, lies with director Baker, who filmed the movie using an iPhone 5S. It’s an amazing achievement – the fluidity of the camerawork is exhilarating at times, the intimacy of the close-ups sometimes unsettling.","Jul 22, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Slant Magazine,75,Ed Gonzalez,"Its triumph is primarily a matter of style, a visionary revelation every bit as expressionistic as its main character's electric sense of shade.","Jun 28, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Movie Nation,75,Roger Moore,"A feisty, funny, down-and-dirty farce as nasty as a Supreme Court dissent, as timely as a Jenner magazine cover.","Jul 7, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,TheWrap,75,Inkoo Kang,"The film bustles along through a series of reveals – a storytelling technique that can lose an audience’s sympathy or suspension of disbelief pretty fast, but which works flawlessly here because the filmmakers and the performers know exactly who their characters are and what kind of world they live in.","Jul 9, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,RogerEbert.com,75,Matt Zoller Seitz,"As written by Sean Baker and Chris Bergoch and directed by Baker, it's assured and immensely likable, and truly independent in story and style.","Jul 10, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Washington Post,75,Ann Hornaday,"As one character observes in Tangerine, Los Angeles is “a beautifully wrapped lie.” Baker has created a fitting homage to artifice and the often tawdry, tender realities that lie beneath.","Jul 16, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,St. Louis Post-Dispatch,75,Calvin Wilson,"Although the story of Sin-Dee and Alexandra might have benefited from a bit more structure, it’s a window into a world of which many people are unaware — but a world that has its share of dreamers.","Aug 6, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,The New Yorker,70,Richard Brody,"Baker revels in the power of clichés and the generic energy of his low-fi cinematography, which is done with a cell phone. The results are picturesque and anecdotal.","Jul 7, 2015"

TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,New York Daily News,60,Jordan Hoffman,"Tangerine offers a warts-and-all depiction of a subculture seldom treated with respect by straight society. The movie handles it in a sincere way that’s entertaining, too.","Jul 9, 2015"

TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Time Out,100,Keith Uhlich,"Nichols has said that the idea for the film emerged from a free-floating anxiety that he sensed in the world at large, the feeling that everything we treasure in life could be lost in an instant.

TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Tampa Bay Times,100,Steve Persall,"Shannon is perfectly cast, a creepily magnetic actor with an otherworldly calm, tight jaw and piercing, set-apart eyes.

TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Village Voice,90,Melissa Anderson,"Despite a few missteps, Take Shelter powerfully lays bare our national anxiety disorder - a pervasive dread that Curtis can define only as ""something that's not right.""","Sep 27, 2011"
TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Wall Street Journal,90,Joe Morgenstern,"A dazzling piece of filmmaking, and much of the dazzle - as well as the anguished darkness - comes from Adam Stone's cinematography, which expresses the swirling state of Curtis's mind with richly varied flavors of light.","Sep 29, 2011"
TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Salon,90,Andrew O'Hehir,"A terrifically crafted little movie that bounces off current events and the nation's downbeat mood ingeniously, and that it variously suggests comparisons with the early work of Terrence Malick, Stanley Kubrick and the Coen brothers. Yeah, I think it's that good, but please note that I also said ""little.""","Sep 29, 2011"
TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Chicago Reader,90,J.R.

TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,The A.V. Club,83,Noel Murray,"Writer-director Jeff Nichols re-teams with his ""Shotgun Stories"" star Michael Shannon for his second feature, Take Shelter, which has a similar setting, but a different mood. Nichols is still concerned with family legacies, and the ways people in smaller communities relate to each other, but Take Shelter is slower and smoother, deliberately developing a mood of creeping dread.","Sep 28, 2011"
TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Variety,80,Justin Chang,"This deliberately paced psychological drama builds an ever-tightening knot of tension around an excellent Michael Shannon, here playing a family man slowly driven mad by apocalyptic visions that could be paranoid, prophetic or both.","Sep 25, 2011"
TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Los Angeles Times,80,Sheri Linden,"From the first moments of the eerie storm that opens the story, dread is the prevailing mood of this pre-apocalyptic drama - a film very much about this moment in time.","Sep 29, 2011"

TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Austin Chronicle,78,Marjorie Baumgarten,"Take Shelter is a deeply unsettling movie.

TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,New York Post,63,Lou Lumenick,It would be possible to appreciate Shannon's fabulous work in Take Shelter far better if the filmmaker lost a quarter of the two-hour running time -- there are many overlong scenes that make this a needlessly tough sit.,"Sep 30, 2011"
TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,San Francisco Chronicle,50,Mick LaSalle,"Take Shelter has a problem, the simplest of all problems but no less serious for its being simple. It's a film without suspense and with a slow-moving story that unfolds without surprise or embellishment.","Oct 6, 2011"

UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,2024,Matthew Rankin,Rolling Stone,100,David Fear,"There is no single category that you can slot Rankin’s mix of a wink, a nudge and an embrace into, so we guess “lo-fi masterpiece” will have to do until a better option comes along.","Feb 14, 2025"

UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,2024,Matthew Rankin,Collider,90,Jason Gorber,"The story navigates the fine line between community pride and nationalistic zeal, providing lessons for a future while admitting to the existential futility of it all.

UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,2024,Matthew Rankin,The New York Times,90,Alissa Wilkinson,"It’s a pensive meditation in an era of displacement, even if the film never tries to make a big point.

UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,2024,Matthew Rankin,The Associated Press,88,Jake Coyle,"Rankin’s film, his second following the also surreal “Twentieth Century” (2019), is propelled less by narrative thrust than the abiding oddity of its basic construction, and the movie’s slavish devotion to seeing it through without a wink.","Feb 18, 2025"

UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,2024,Matthew Rankin,The A.V. Club,83,Jacob Oller,"To further dig into Rankin’s blending of the goofily left-field and the openly earnest, the message persisting through the dry punchlines is that to care for your neighbor, to care for all the oddities of home, is to care for yourself.","Feb 12, 2025"
UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,2024,Matthew Rankin,Variety,80,Peter Debruge,"Rankin may have conceived Universal Language in the spirit of homage, but there’s something undeniably original about the end result.

EO,2022,Jerzy Skolimowski,Los Angeles Times,100,Justin Chang,"In EO, the camera doesn’t just follow the story or record the action. Its restless, exploratory movements express a kind of shared consciousness, a spirit of communion among different members of the animal world, whether they’re running together in a field or sharing the same tight enclosure. It’s the grace of this movie to extend that communion to the human beings who pass in front of the camera, and whose fates are tightly bound up with EO’s, whether they realize it or not.","Dec 7, 2022"

EO,2022,Jerzy Skolimowski,Original-Cin,91,Liam Lacey,"What draws us in is the inventive and luminous cinematography from Michal Dymek (with additional footage by Pawel Edelman and Michal Englert), using drone shots, fish-eye lenses and red and blue filters.

Those qualities are not necessarily all concentrated in Judy Greer, either. Even if the film moves in circles, at least it’s circling something honest and true about spirituality and society alike.","Jun 12, 2023"
ERIC LARUE,2025,Michael Shannon,Collider,50,Taylor Gates,"There are several interesting ideas and stories floating around Eric LaRue, but Shannon can’t seem to decide which ones to focus on.

THE FOUNTAIN,2006,Darren Aronofsky,Rolling Stone,63,Peter Travers,"In telling a tale of love across time, Aronofsky is sometimes guilty of creating arty, pretentious psychobabble. But in visual terms, he's trying to expose his own raw, romantic heart. Folly? Maybe. But a risk worth taking.",
THE FOUNTAIN,2006,Darren Aronofsky,Chicago Tribune,63,Michael Wilmington,"It's possible to admire or respect a movie without enjoying it too much, and that's partly the reaction I had to Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain.

THE FOUNTAIN,2006,Darren Aronofsky,Miami Herald,50,Rene Rodriguez,"The Fountain is probably too muddled and half-baked to even attain cult status -- but you can still see what writer-director Darren Aronofsky was striving for, and even if his reach exceeded his grasp, his intentions were both admirable and worthy of respect.",

CAT PEOPLE,1982,Paul Schrader,Newsweek,100,Jack Kroll,"Cat People retains the psychological suggestiveness of the original while adding a blazing, carefully controlled eroticism and violence as well as state-of-the-art special effects and a ravishing over-all physical design. And it has the quintessential cat-person in Nastassia Kinski. As with all horror classics, what might be ludicrous is transformed into something gripping by the passionate logic of a grotesque metaphor. Alan Ormsby's screenplay has the logic and Paul Schrader has the passion. The result is Schrader's best work as a director. [05 Apr 1982, p.74]",
CAT PEOPLE,1982,Paul Schrader,Washington Post,90,Rita Kempley,"The throbbing, urgent score by Giorgio Moroder, the cat jokes and the stylish look make Cat People a purrfectly good Meow Mix. [02 Apr 1982, p.11]",
CAT PEOPLE,1982,Paul Schrader,Chicago Sun-Times,88,Roger Ebert,"Cat People moves back and forth between its mythic and realistic levels, held together primarily by the strength of Kinski's performance and John Heard's obsession. Kinski is something. She never overacts in this movie, never steps wrong, never seems ridiculous; she just steps onscreen and convincingly underplays a leopard. Heard also is good.",
CAT PEOPLE,1982,Paul Schrader,Variety,80,Staff (Not Credited),"Paul Schrader’s reworking of the 1942 Val Lewton-Jacques Tourneur Cat People is a super-chic erotic horror story of mixed impact. Kinski was essential to the film as conceived, and she’s endlessly watchable.",
CAT PEOPLE,1982,Paul Schrader,Slant Magazine,75,Chuck Bowen,"The opening credits immediately insist that director Paul Schrader isn’t interested in merely reprising your grandparents’ beloved version of Cat People, the 1942 horror film memorably directed by Jacques Tourneur and produced by Val Lewton. Set to the background of a profoundly bright brick red, which is soon revealed to be a desert jungle-scape, Giorgio Moroder’s primal synth score prepares us for an erotic blowout that overtly literalizes the Cat People conceit for the sake of a little soft porn fun.",
CAT PEOPLE,1982,Paul Schrader,Slant Magazine,75,Ed Gonzalez,"Unjustifiably compared to the original film upon its release, Schrader’s Cat People is more of an erotic reinvention of the Bodeen story. Though Schrader keeps the Fangoria crowd at bay with a series of grisly tableaus, he remains less concerned with the body-horrific than he does with the rituals of sex—mandatory and otherwise.",
CAT PEOPLE,1982,Paul Schrader,The Dissolve,70,Nathan Rabin,"While Cat People feels like an early Bruckheimer production, it’s also permeated with the themes that personify Schrader’s work as a screenwriter and filmmaker: obsession, sex, the strange permutations of destiny, and man’s bottomless capacity for cruelty and violence.",
CAT PEOPLE,1982,Paul Schrader,The Globe and Mail (Toronto),63,Jay Scott,"Cat People, a remake by the not noticeably gifted director Paul Schrader, of a 1942 RKO mood piece about a lady who thought herself capable of turning into a panther, is many things, not every one of them bad: as a B-movie, this fantasy of a young woman who develops the distressing habit of changing shape after sex is moderately entertaining.

CAT PEOPLE,1982,Paul Schrader,Empire,60,Kim Newman,"It's not exactly good, and it has some very bad scenes indeed, but the performances sometimes sparkle and the unusual happy ending -- scored with David Bowie's 'Putting Out the Fire With Gasoline' -- is surprisingly moving.",
CAT PEOPLE,1982,Paul Schrader,TV Guide Magazine,50,,"Director Paul Schrader's dreamlike, stylishly atmospheric remake of Val Lewton's 1942 horror classic needs to be taken on its own terms: viewers who assent to its Freudian logic and creepy sexuality will likely be entranced, but just a little critical distance renders the whole thing irretrievably ludicrous.",

LIGHT SLEEPER,1992,Paul Schrader,Empire,80,Kim Newman,This doesn't have the high style that made Taxi Driver or American Gigolo instant cultural icons - although Schrader shows more than a few traces of Scorsese as his camera creeps- perhaps because it's concerned with a chilly 90s that looks back with a sort of nostalgia on the cocaine-fuelled craziness of earlier years. But it does develop powerfully the themes of Schrader's earlier work and will not disappoint his fans.,
LIGHT SLEEPER,1992,Paul Schrader,Rolling Stone,75,Peter Travers,"Schrader is out there again, testing the limits of audience tolerance. Good for him. Buoyed by his questing spirit and Dafoe's mesmerizing performance, Light Sleeper might just keep you up nights.",

LIGHT SLEEPER,1992,Paul Schrader,The Seattle Times,75,Jeff Shannon,"Schrader's dialogue ranks among his best, and Sarandon chews up her delightful role with infectious, boldly confrontational relish.

LIGHT SLEEPER,1992,Paul Schrader,Chicago Tribune,75,Gene Siskel,"A problem with Schrader's script is that he too slavishly follows the Taxi Driver outline, needlessly giving a violent conclusion to Light Sleeper. We sit there noting the resemblance to the 1975 movie more than being absorbed into the drama. Nonetheless, Light Sleeper is emblematic of an era, and is recommended on that basis and on the excellent quality of it acting. We remember the character more than we believe the machinations they've run through.",
LIGHT SLEEPER,1992,Paul Schrader,St. Louis Post-Dispatch,75,Joe Pollack,"In the end, Light Sleeper is slightly more optimistic than some of Schrader's earlier works, but it's a tough, hard-nosed film that shows, in small moments here and there, what life in drugs is all about - and it ain't all about fun.

TO A LAND UNKNOWN,2025,Mahdi Fleifel,The Film Verdict,90,Adham Youssef,"Fleifel’s influences are many, from 1970’s Hollywood to Palestinian poetry to American novels, as he readily admits in his interviews, but To A Land Unknown is unique in its brutal realism; a heartbreaking tribute to exiled people.","Jun 5, 2024"
TO A LAND UNKNOWN,2025,Mahdi Fleifel,Screen Daily,90,Robert Daniels,"Arrestingly plotted and bracingly acted, this story about the biting hardships faced by refugees who have left the danger of their homeland only to be left nationless could hardly be more relevant.","Jun 5, 2024"

TO A LAND UNKNOWN,2025,Mahdi Fleifel,The Film Stage,83,David Katz,"With inspiration taken from the somber wave of ’70s American buddy movies, To a Land Unknown will comfortably endear itself to audiences, avoiding anything overly discursive so it can thrive provoking anger and pathos.","Jun 5, 2024"

VIET AND NAM,2024,Truong Minh Quy,RogerEbert.com,100,Simon Abrams,Việt and Nam only initially looks like something that you might expect to find on John Waters’ Best of the Year list. Soon enough the movie becomes a gentle romance about loving the dead.,"Mar 28, 2025"
VIET AND NAM,2024,Truong Minh Quy,The Hollywood Reporter,90,Lovia Gyarkye,"In exploring how the ruptures of the past map themselves onto relationships in the present, [Quy] elegantly approaches a familiar theme: how war reverberates throughout generations, imposing on witnesses and their successors.","Oct 8, 2024"

VIET AND NAM,2024,Truong Minh Quy,IndieWire,83,Josh Slater-Williams,"While a degree of naturalism does still make its way into many slow-burn scenes, Quy’s filmmaking largely favors expressionism.","Jun 5, 2024"
VIET AND NAM,2024,Truong Minh Quy,The Film Stage,83,Luke Hicks,"Minh Quý’s slow-cinema sensibilities are nothing short of spellbinding, the trance of rumination within reason enough to seek it out. And if that’s not enough, go for the best final shot of the year: a breath-stealing beauty that will leave you frozen in your seat even after the credits are over.","Nov 1, 2024"
VIET AND NAM,2024,Truong Minh Quy,Screen Daily,80,John Berra,"Viet And Nam may studiously occupy a certain world cinema niche, but Truong’s flourishes ensure that it offers a richly personal blend of the authentic and the abstract.","Jun 10, 2024"
VIET AND NAM,2024,Truong Minh Quy,The Film Verdict,60,Clarence Tsui,"While the film is filled with shimmering images aplenty – including a literally sparkling trompe d’oeil – the director falls short of using the texture of his 16mm film stock to its full potential. The same could be said of his characters, who could do with more thoughtful fleshing out, while their slow-burning relationships generate more a sense of lethargy than melancholy.","Jun 10, 2024"

GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,Los Angeles Times,100,Tim Grierson,"The characters’ dilemma may, ultimately, be meaningless set against the ebbs and flows of history, but Gomes, who won the directing prize at last year’s Cannes Film Festival, invests it with such elegance that it becomes nearly mythic: a touching fable of cowardice and devotion with tragic undertones. The scenes may be dreamlike, but they’re our shared dream of being swept away by the movies.","Mar 28, 2025"

GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,Screen Daily,90,Jonathan Romney,"A hypnotic and inventive Asian odyssey ...

GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,Variety,90,Jessica Kiang,"But for anyone feeling a pessimism creeping in like slow poison and taking the edge off any appetite for adventure, Portuguese singularity Miguel Gomes comes like a comet across the Cannes competition with “Grand Tour,” an enchanting, enlivening, era-spanning, continent-crossing travelogue that runs the very serious risk of infecting you with the antidote: a potent dose of wanderlust-for-life.","May 22, 2024"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,New York Magazine (Vulture),90,Bilge Ebiri,"The film returns us to a childlike gaze, marveling at a world alive with possibility, where every sight lives on a continuum of meaning.","Oct 10, 2024"

GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,The Film Verdict,78,Deborah Young,"Gomes is a director poised between ironic narrative and experimentalism pure and simple, and his films (often described as strange, lyrical and hypnotizing) divide audiences into the visionaries and the unconvinced.","May 23, 2024"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,RogerEbert.com,75,Glenn Kenny,"Viewers looking for a tidy narrative and gratifying conclusions will come up short with this movie. But if you can roll with atmospherics that are their own reason for being, “Grand Tour” has plenty, and they’re all beautifully realized.","Mar 28, 2025"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,TheWrap,70,Chase Hutchinson,"It is a wholly uncompromising experience that dances with mirth and melancholy. Proving to be evocative in one moment and unrelentingly exhausting in the next, it’s as gorgeous to behold visually as it is hard to completely embrace thematically. And yet, if you abandon yourself to it by the end as one character says, you can catch glimpses of something spectacularly sublime in the vast journey that it takes on.","May 27, 2024"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,IndieWire,67,David Ehrlich,"But for all the luminous beauty of its images, ""Grand Tour"" sorely lacks a current strong enough to sustain the thoughts that flow between them, compelling as some of those thoughts may be.","May 22, 2024"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,The Hollywood Reporter,60,Jordan Mintzer,"Fans of Gomes’ breakthrough 2012 feature, Tabu, will find much to love here as well, and in terms of craft his latest offers some truly beguiling moments. But anyone looking for a good story, or characters to get hooked on, may find themselves admiring the scenery without ever relishing it.","May 22, 2024"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,Collider,60,Aidan Kelley,"The film does show that Gomes is capable of making an authentic period piece and a stunning documentary, but the attempt of trying to do both at the same time has led to an unusual experiment that will leave one scratching their head.","Jan 21, 2025"
