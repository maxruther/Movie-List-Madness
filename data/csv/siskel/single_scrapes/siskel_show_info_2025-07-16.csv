3 WOMEN,1977,Robert Altman,124,Robert Altman Centennial,,USA,In English | Format: Digital,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//3-women,3 WOMEN,"When the introverted Pinky (Sissy Spacek) comes to work at a health spa in a California desert town, she is immediately drawn to Millie (Shelley Duvall), an incessantly chatty co-worker. The women become roommates, but Millie rejects Pinky’s fascination with her, driving Pinky to an act of self harm. As Pinky recovers, she begins to take on Millie’s extroverted behavior, and Millie retreats into a quieter version of herself. Ever-present is the enigmatic Willie (Janice Rule), a muralist and the pregnant wife of their womanizing landlord Edgar. Altman’s daring and dyadic vision, which pays homage to Ingmar Bergman’s PERSONA and paves the way for David Lynch’s MUHOLLAND DRIVE, is an eerie and unsettling watch, which came to Altman from a dream he had when his wife Kathryn was in the hospital. Reflections and faces are seen in water, windows, and mirrors as Altman blurs the line between reality and illusion in this haunting puzzle of female identity.",Siskel,2025-07-16T16:10:47.721576+00:00

Altman’s musical adaptation of E. C. Segar's comic, starring Robin Williams as the titular sailor man and Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl, generally bewildered critics, who couldn’t get “all aboard!” Altman’s vision of Popeye’s adventures searching for his long lost father, falling in love with Olive Oyl, and raising the adopted Swee’ Pee. Newsday likened watching POPEYE to being “trapped in a stalled elevator or a doomed submarine with raving lunatics without fresh air.” Forty-five years on, however, at the core of this eccentric comedy, with its ambitious production design and committed performances by Williams and Duvall, Altman is exploring familiar waters: a story about human behavior.

Connecting Bouvia’s story to his own as a disabled person, Davenport uncovers shocking abuses of power while amplifying the voices of the disability community fighting for justice and dignity in an unfolding matter of life and death. LIFE AFTER brings together the missing voices of the disability community in the ongoing debate about assisted dying, uncovering chilling stories of disabled people dying prematurely. Davenport exposes the intersection of systemic failures and personal autonomy, challenging the idea that assisted dying always represents a free choice, when it can sometimes be seen as the only option.

As he waits for passage, he becomes trapped in the port city of Marseilles in the company of others desperate to escape. While in limbo, he encounters a woman searching for her missing husband—the man whose identity he has assumed.",Siskel,2025-07-16T16:10:47.721576+00:00
SHORT CUTS,1993,Robert Altman,188,Robert Altman Centennial,35mm,USA,In English | Format: 35mm,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//short-cuts,SHORT CUTS,"In the night sky, helicopters circle and spray, raining insecticide indiscriminately over Los Angeles residents. We meet 23 of them—portrayed by Matthew Modine, Julianne Moore, Fred Ward, Anne Archer, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Robert Downey Jr., Lili Taylor, Madeleine Stowe, Chris Penn, Jack Lemmon, Frances McDormand, Tim Robbins, Lori Singer, Peter Gallagher, Andie MacDowell, Buck Henry, Zane Cassidy, Lily Tomlin, Annie Ross, Bruce Davidson, Huey Lewis, Lyle Lovett, and Tom Waits—whose lives intersect over the course of a weekend. Adapted from the stories of Raymond Carver, SHORT CUTS is a grand vision that, like Los Angeles, sprawls: across marriages, sex, death, and hope. Epic in scale but abundant with moments of intimacy, SHORT CUTS, for which Altman received his fourth Academy Award nomination for Best Director, is an unforgettable portrait of the beauty and chaos of everyday life. 35mm print courtesy of the Robert Altman Collection at the UCLA Film & Television Archive.",Siskel,2025-07-16T16:10:47.721576+00:00
"THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY",1966,Sergio Leone,178,Scorchers,4K Digital Restoration,Italy/Spain/West Germany/USA,In English and Italian with English subtitles | Format: 4K digital restoration,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//good-bad-and-ugly,"THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY","Set in the sun-drenched Southwest during the Civil War, two men—an unnamed drifter (Clint Eastwood) and the bandit Tuco (Eli Wallach)—form an uneasy alliance after they learn that $200,000 is hidden in an unmarked grave. As Tuco knows the cemetery location, and the drifter knows which grave holds the cache, the two set out across war zones to find and share the reward. Meanwhile, the criminal Setenza (Lee Van Cleef) is on his own hunt for the cash and will do anything to claim it for himself. Sergio Leone’s operatic masterpiece, set to Ennio Morricone’s iconic score, dismantles audiences ideas of the romantic western; this is an unforgiving landscape where there is no John Wayne coming to save the day, and even if you survive the final standoff (and what a standoff it is!), you don’t ride off into the sunset, but under a blazingly hot sun.",Siskel,2025-07-16T16:10:47.721576+00:00

Boiling. Baking. Sweltering...,” he murmurs). Happily retired, Gal and his wife’s languid life is shattered by the arrival of the psychotic gangster Don Logan (Ben Kingsley, in an electrifying, Academy Award–nominated performance), who is intent on persuading Gal to do one more big job. Reticent to return to a life of crime, Gal is given little choice to refuse Don without dire consequences. A slick and stylish crime caper, SEXY BEAST is also a red hot thriller that threatens to boil over at any minute.

When Tennessee teacher Bertram Cates is put on trial for teaching evolution instead of creationism, he is defended in a sweltering courtroom by Chicago lawyer and atheist Henry Drummond (Spencer Tracy), against a prosecution team that includes Biblical scholar and zealot Matthew Brady (Fredric March). As the public gallery fans themselves (“I’ll pack my bags and go back to Chicago where it’s a nice, cool 100 degrees in the shade,” Drummond quips), a masterful verbal sparring match about ignorance fueled by religious righteousness plays out. Capturing it all is reporter E.K Hornbeck (Gene Kelly), adding to the feeling that, if it weren’t for the suspenders and the lack of air conditioning, INHERIT THE WIND could be a 2025 new release coming to a theater near you.",Siskel,2025-07-16T16:10:47.721576+00:00

When their friend Harry (Maurice Ronet) and his daughter Penelope (Jane Birkin) come to visit, old rivalries return and new attractions spark, and the once placid and pleasurable summer becomes a turbulent and tense reunion. In addition to the scorching sun, Delon and Schneider, once a couple in real life (so beautiful a pair, they were nicknamed “the magnificent lovers”) saturate the film with their white hot, crackling chemistry.

Luke refuses to conform to the prison’s authoritarian leadership, which makes him a target of the warden and rifleman, and his defiance puts him at odds with top dog prisoner Dragline (George Kennedy, in an Academy Award–winning performance), until a sweat-soaked, knock- down, drag-out fight between the two earns Luke Dragline’s admiration and respect. Tenacious and resilient, Luke challenges the boundaries of what is expected of him as a prisoner and fellow inmate, turning him into a symbol of resistance against oppressive authority, and a hero within the gang. Shirts stick to sweaty backs and the unrelenting heat and abuse weighs heavily on the captive men, even the seemingly unbreakable Cool Hand Luke, in this classic and devastating story of hope and heroes.",Siskel,2025-07-16T16:10:47.721576+00:00

In her fourth feature, Reichardt’s pensive spin on the heist genre revolves around three radical eco-activists (played by Jesse Eisenberg, Dakota Fanning, and Peter Sarsgaard), who conspire to blow up a dam. Boasting a showstopping, nerve-racking centerpiece, the film is a probing look at the psychological consequences of political action and the tensions between peaceful personal ideology and violent, declarative protest.",Siskel,2025-07-16T16:10:47.721576+00:00

Julian Fellows’ (later of Downton Abbey fame) delicious dissection of the British class structure is brought to lavish life in Altman’s late career whodunit. Set in 1930s England, a group of aristocrats (Kristin Scott Thomas, Michael Gambon, Tom Hollander, Maggie Smith) gather at a grand estate for a weekend of hunting, as their maids, butlers, and valets (Hellen Mirren, Clive Owen, Kelly Macdonald, Emily Watson) assemble to serve them. Simmering tensions, clandestine conversations, and multi-course dinners are disrupted when a member of the ruling class is murdered (twice!), and everyone—both upstairs and down—is a suspect. Garnering Altman his fifth Best Director Academy Award nomination, a nomination for Best Picture, and a Best Original Screenplay win for Fellows (as well as Best Supporting Actress noms for both Smith and Mirren), GOSFORD PARK proved that no one can do “Altmanesque” better than Altman.",Siskel,2025-07-16T16:10:47.721576+00:00

THE BIRDS spares no child, adult, updo, or body part from the feathered freaks raining down from the sky.

Gregory Peck was cast as a kidnapped hieroglyphics expert with Sophia Loren as the woman who helps him escape certain death; their enthusiasm for the project carried the film into production, despite Donen’s growing distaste for its script. Rather than attempt to rein in its jumbled intrigues and inscrutable motivations, Donen opted to focus on the film’s visual design, bringing a dazzling and experimental flamboyance to action set pieces (including a bonkers LSD-addled bicycle chase and a deadly showdown during an optometry appointment) and otherwise-rote exposition alike.

Alan J. Pakula’s second collaboration with legendary lensman Gordon Willis (KLUTE, THE GODFATHER) wedded the burgeoning genre of “American political thriller” to a severe, Antonioni-ish sense of scale, composition, and color—Beatty and other puny humans are frequently dwarfed by pale, unfeeling cityscapes and gargantuan modernist architecture in vibrant primary hues. Among the film’s other monuments: a small, stirring performance from the great Paula Prentiss that serves as the story’s emotional linchpin. (Gabriel Wallace)",Siskel,2025-07-16T16:10:47.721576+00:00

What more do you need to know? Frank Tashlin, directing the Maestro for the eighth and final time, delivers a blistering cavalcade of visual gags, aural puns, and hospital slapstick, with his signature cartoon-bred flourishes that (arguably) propel Lewis’s manic schticking to the level of High American Pop. The film occasionally explodes with garish chromatic touches as though it’s moonlighting as a test film for the Technicolor process itself. We must also single out for praise the title song, surely one of filmdom’s most bizarre, which is hauntingly crooned over the opening credits by Sammy Davis, Jr. Don’t find a gag funny?

Beloved for its beautiful Sherman Brothers songs, the incredible performances of Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke, and its 14-minute chimney sweep dance sequence, MARY POPPINS may also be more timely than ever, a film which advocates for charity, humility, laughter, and common sense in a world which increasingly lacks all of these things.

A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION fittingly serves as a farewell from Altman: a tribute to the enduring power of storytelling, and a bittersweet ode to goodbyes.
