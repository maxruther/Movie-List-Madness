The spectacular Musée d’Orsay exhibition brings fresh eyes to this extraordinary story of passion and rebellion, told not by historians and curators, but in the words of those who witnessed the dawn of Impressionism: the artists, press, and people of Paris, 1874. Made in collaboration with the Musee d’Orsay and National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C. Siskel Film Center exclusive."

FEMALE TROUBLE,1974,John Waters,89,Summer Camp,35mm,USA,In English | Format: 35mm,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//female-trouble,FEMALE TROUBLE,"This series would be incomplete without a film from John Waters, the “King of Camp,” who lives and breathes artifice and lives exaggeration. In FEMALE TROUBLE, Divine stars as Dawn Davenport, a runaway who goes on a nightmarish journey defined by abuse, petty crime, cosmetology, and fame. Waters, aka the “Pope of Trash,” finds extravagance in the filth, which he embraces with all the seriousness camp requires. As Sontag writes, “Camp taste is a kind of love for human nature. It relishes, rather than judges.”"
