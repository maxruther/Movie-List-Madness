LOVE HOTEL,1985,Shinji Somai,88,New Releases & Restorations,"Now Playing, 2K Digital Restoration",Japan,In Japanese with English subtitles | Format: 2K Digital Restoration,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//love-hotel,LOVE HOTEL,"In Shinji Sômai’s tale of two broken people, a call girl named Yumi and a grieving man named Tetsuro have a violent rendezvous in a cheap hotel. Years later, they meet again and begin a strange affair. An unnerving work of erotica, Sômai explores how two souls are intrinsically linked. With long takes and a sparing use of music, LOVE HOTEL is a haunting, voyeuristic viewing experience. As Ryusuke Hamaguchi (DRIVE MY CAR) declared, “For anyone who wants to see a movie that has the power to change and sustain your life, I urge you to see Sômai’s films.” Content consideration: contains scenes of sexual violence."
KILLER OF SHEEP,1978,Charles Burnett,80,New Releases & Restorations,"Now Playing, 4K Digital Restoration",USA,In English | Format: 4K Digital Restoration,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//killer-sheep,KILLER OF SHEEP,"Charles Burnett’s landmark film, submitted as his UCLA Master’s thesis, is a quietly powerful exploration of Black working-class life in Los Angeles. Stan works at a slaughterhouse in Watts, labor he abhors. The burden of his work mirrors his strained marriage and the stress of the daily grind, causing Stan to question whether a better way of life is possible. Burnett’s minimalist style creates a deeply resonant portrait of hardship and resilience in a tough, unforgiving world. Of his first feature, Burnett explained, “You don’t necessarily win battles; you survive.” Restored and remastered by UCLA Film & Television Archive, Milestone Films, and the Criterion Collection. Restoration supervised by Ross Lipman and Jillian Borders in consultation with Charles Burnett."
AT THE RISK OF SEEMING RIDICULOUS,1994,Mary Patten,75,Conversations at the Edge,Artist Dialogue,USA,In English | Format: Digital,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//mary-patten,Mary Patten: AT THE RISK OF SEEMING RIDICULOUS,"The work of Chicago-based artist and activist Mary Patten operates between the realms of poetry and politics, posing expansive questions drawn from a life deeply engaged with social and political movements. In a program wryly titled after a truncated quote by Che Guevara, she presents a selection of readings and videos spanning from the mid-1990s to the present. These include video essays, diaries, and documentation of the fight against the AIDS epidemic, struggles to free political prisoners, and anti-imperialist movements. Often assembled from the fragments of everyday life—newspaper clippings, letters, snapshots, half-remembered conversations, found objects, and other ephemera—these works embody Patten’s project to face as well as fictionalize her “checkered biography” and its contradictory entanglements between the call to respond to political urgencies and the desire to live an “artist’s life.” Followed by a conversation with the artist."
