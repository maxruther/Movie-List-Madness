WHERE IS THE FRIEND'S HOUSE?,1987,Abbas Kiarostami,83,Rise & Shine,,Iran,In Persian with English subtitles | Format: Digital,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//where-friends-house,WHERE IS THE FRIEND'S HOUSE?,"In Abbas Kiarostami’s splendid WHERE IS THE FRIEND’S HOUSE?, a young boy named Ahmed accidentally takes home his classmate Reza’s notebook, and—knowing Reza will be expelled if he shows up to school the next day without it—sets off to find his home to return it. Kiarostami transforms this seemingly simple errand into an epic hero’s journey, as Ahmed determinedly climbs hills and asks strangers for directions, steadfast in his mission to help his classmate. The first film in Kiarostami’s wonderous Koker Trilogy (followed by AND LIFE GOES ON and THROUGH THE OLIVE TREES), WHERE IS THE FRIEND’S HOUSE? is a delicate and divine fable of altruism, friendship, and kindness, and a gentle reminder that even the smallest of gestures can have an enormous impact. If you haven’t cried happy tears in awhile, this screening should do the trick.",Siskel,2025-07-19T00:02:01.171834+00:00

CHINATOWN,1974,Roman Polanski,130,Spoiler Alert,35mm,USA,"In English, Cantonese, and Spanish with English subtitles | Format: 35mm",https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//chinatown,CHINATOWN,"In this stylish neo-noir, L.A. private detective Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is hired to investigate a case of marital infidelity involving the chief engineer at the Department of Water and Power. When the man in question turns up dead, Gittes uncovers a web of corruption and lies involving the dead man’s wife (Faye Dunaway) and her father (John Huston). Any murder mystery is bound to include a few revelations— that’s no surprise—but in CHINATOWN, as the D.A. warns him, “You think you know what you’re dealing with, but you don’t.” Perhaps more stunning than the film’s most infamous reveal is that, in Chinatown, even when Jake solves the case, he can’t erase the sins of bad men, and there can be no real justice.",Siskel,2025-07-19T00:02:01.171834+00:00
3 WOMEN,1977,Robert Altman,124,Robert Altman Centennial,,USA,In English | Format: Digital,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//3-women,3 WOMEN,"When the introverted Pinky (Sissy Spacek) comes to work at a health spa in a California desert town, she is immediately drawn to Millie (Shelley Duvall), an incessantly chatty co-worker. The women become roommates, but Millie rejects Pinky’s fascination with her, driving Pinky to an act of self harm. As Pinky recovers, she begins to take on Millie’s extroverted behavior, and Millie retreats into a quieter version of herself. Ever-present is the enigmatic Willie (Janice Rule), a muralist and the pregnant wife of their womanizing landlord Edgar. Altman’s daring and dyadic vision, which pays homage to Ingmar Bergman’s PERSONA and paves the way for David Lynch’s MUHOLLAND DRIVE, is an eerie and unsettling watch, which came to Altman from a dream he had when his wife Kathryn was in the hospital. Reflections and faces are seen in water, windows, and mirrors as Altman blurs the line between reality and illusion in this haunting puzzle of female identity.",Siskel,2025-07-19T00:02:01.171834+00:00

When he is suddenly released and challenged to find his captor, Dae-su Oh is plunged into a grisly game of cat and mouse, where acts of exquisitely choreographed violence serve as an outlet for his years of pain, and a dark history that traces far beyond the night he was imprisoned is slowly revealed. Korean master Park Chan-wook (DECISION TO LEAVE) stunned audiences with this twisted tale of revenge; when OLDBOY’s jaw dropping denouement arrives, you’ll want us to start the film again from the bloody beginning.

POPEYE,1980,Robert Altman,114,Robert Altman Centennial,35mm,USA,In English | Format: 35mm,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//popeye,POPEYE,"Now regarded as a cult classic and nostalgic favorite, POPEYE was a critical disaster—though a financial success, earning more than double its budget at the box office. Altman’s musical adaptation of E. C. Segar's comic, starring Robin Williams as the titular sailor man and Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl, generally bewildered critics, who couldn’t get “all aboard!” Altman’s vision of Popeye’s adventures searching for his long lost father, falling in love with Olive Oyl, and raising the adopted Swee’ Pee. Newsday likened watching POPEYE to being “trapped in a stalled elevator or a doomed submarine with raving lunatics without fresh air.” Forty-five years on, however, at the core of this eccentric comedy, with its ambitious production design and committed performances by Williams and Duvall, Altman is exploring familiar waters: a story about human behavior. Altman and Popeye aren’t an incongruous pairing: they both yam what they yam. 35mm print courtesy of the Robert Altman Collection at the UCLA Film & Television Archive. Both screenings will be introduced by author and POPEYE historian Ryan M. Maxwell.",Siskel,2025-07-19T00:02:01.171834+00:00

Determined to keep the shocking ending of the film about hotel proprietor Norman Bates a secret, Alfred Hitchcock and Paramount Pictures mounted a massive campaign to encourage audiences to keep quiet, including not allowing anyone into the theater after the film began, and printing newspaper ads imploring, “Don’t give away the ending. It’s the only one we have.” (Legend has it, to keep the twist under wraps, “Hitch” even bought all the copies of Robert Bloch’s Psycho). It worked: everyone wanted to know the secret, and PSYCHO became the second highest-grossing film of 1960.",Siskel,2025-07-19T00:02:01.171834+00:00

Connecting Bouvia’s story to his own as a disabled person, Davenport uncovers shocking abuses of power while amplifying the voices of the disability community fighting for justice and dignity in an unfolding matter of life and death. LIFE AFTER brings together the missing voices of the disability community in the ongoing debate about assisted dying, uncovering chilling stories of disabled people dying prematurely. Davenport exposes the intersection of systemic failures and personal autonomy, challenging the idea that assisted dying always represents a free choice, when it can sometimes be seen as the only option. Content consideration: includes themes of assisted suicide, institutionalization, and the death of disabled people. Director Reid Davenport in attendance for a post screening discussion moderated by Cassidy Dimon, Executive Director of FWD-Doc.",Siskel,2025-07-19T00:02:01.171834+00:00

As Ned falls hard for Matty, she tells him about her unhappy marriage to her wealthy husband, and the two hatch a plot to murder him and claim his fortune. Blinded by lust, Ned begins to realize that he’s one step behind what he thought was a perfect crime. Set against a sweltering Florida summer, Lawrence Kasdan’s BODY HEAT is a classic erotic drama of the 1980s (even if it was set in winter, Hurt and Turner’s chemistry would be red hot), and an homage to film noir, replete with a jazzy score and a barn-burner of a twist ending.",Siskel,2025-07-19T00:02:01.171834+00:00
