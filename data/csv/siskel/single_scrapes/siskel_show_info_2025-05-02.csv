Years later, they meet again and begin a strange affair. An unnerving work of erotica, Sômai explores how two souls are intrinsically linked.

It is 2023. Amid Ukraine’s brutalizing counteroffensive, the film follows Ukrainian platoons as they traverse a thin corridor of decimated forest, fighting for every inch of their land and creeping ever closer—2000 meters, 1000 meters, 500 meters—to retake the town of Andriivka. Mstyslav Chernov skillfully balances heart-stopping helmet-cam combat footage with profoundly intimate moments with the soldiers, revealing their vulnerability and humanity. Still as timely as ever, with stakes that couldn’t be higher for the Ukrainian people, or for Chernov himself. Winner of a Sundance Directing Award, 2000 METERS TO ANDRIIKVA is “gut wrenching” (Toronto Star), “pensively devastating” (Variety), and “the most unbearably intense war documentary you’ll ever see” (The Daily Beast)"

WRITTEN ON THE WIND,1956,Douglas Sirk,99,Summer Camp,,USA,In English | Format: Digital,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//written-wind,WRITTEN ON THE WIND,"Douglas Sirk’s WRITTEN ON THE WIND, his most melodramatic domestic tragedy, was a box office smash, and is still considered a Technicolor masterpiece, as well as a camp classic. Lauren Bacall stars alongside Rock Hudson, Robert Stack, and Dorothy Malone (in a deliciously vicious, Academy Award–winning performance) in this saga of a rich Texas oil family caught in a spiral of sex, jealousy, and lots of booze. Opulently designed (The Village Voice’s J.Hoberman said the film has a “lurid classical grandeur that suggests Norman Rockwell redecorating Versailles”), WRITTEN ON THE WIND is serious, perverse, and seriously perverse."

Much ink was spilled about on-set drama, with gossip rags declaring that Davis and Crawford despised each other—is BABY JANE camp because of the alleged feud? If it was real, and these women were out for blood, then what a campy show indeed, but if you ignore the lore, Davis and Crawford’s performances, while not subtle, are sensational."

Released during the Vietnam War but set during the Korean War (20th Century Fox insisted Korea be referenced in the opening sequence for fear the film would reinforce anti-Vietnam War sentiment) M*A*S*H’s medics, led by surgeons ""Hawkeye"" (Donald Sutherland) and ""Duke"" (Tom Skerritt), mere miles from the front lines, use bawdy pranks to cope with the horrors of combat. A sharp commentary on the absurdity of war wrapped in a blue comedy, M*A*S*H suggests that instead of crying, you might as well laugh. M*A*S*H was in production simultaneously with Fox’s PATTON and TORA! TORA! TORA! “Those were big-budget pictures, and we were cheap,” Altman said. “I knew that if I stayed under budget and didn't cause too much trouble, we could sneak it through."" M*A*S*H won the Palme d’Or at Cannes, garnered five Academy Award nominations, including Altman’s first for Best Director, and became the third highest-grossing film of 1970."
GREY GARDENS,1975,"David Maysles, Albert Maysles, Ellen Hovde, Muffie Meyer",95,Summer Camp,,USA,In English | Format: Digital,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//grey-gardens,GREY GARDENS,"In Slate, J. Bryan Lowder wrote what makes the documentary GREY GARDENS in part a camp classic, and “one of the most prominent and oft-cited entries in the canon of gay culture,” is that Big Edie and Little Edie Beale, the reclusive cousins of Jackie Onassis, are intimately captured, in their deteriorating house in East Hampton, without an ounce of judgement. “The filmmakers simply allow them to be,” Lowder writes. That uninhibited freedom is, as Sontag writes, a hallmark of camp: “a proper mixture of the exaggerated, the fantastic, the passionate and the naive.”"
FEMALE TROUBLE,1974,John Waters,89,Summer Camp,35mm,USA,In English | Format: 35mm,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//female-trouble,FEMALE TROUBLE,"This series would be incomplete without a film from John Waters, the “King of Camp,” who lives and breathes artifice and lives exaggeration. In FEMALE TROUBLE, Divine stars as Dawn Davenport, a runaway who goes on a nightmarish journey defined by abuse, petty crime, cosmetology, and fame. Waters, aka the “Pope of Trash,” finds extravagance in the filth, which he embraces with all the seriousness camp requires. As Sontag writes, “Camp taste is a kind of love for human nature. It relishes, rather than judges.”"
SHOWGIRLS,1995,Paul Verhoeven,128,Summer Camp,4K Digital Restoration,USA/France,In English | Format: 4K Digital Restoration,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//showgirls,SHOWGIRLS,"At first, this NC-17 tale about stripper Nomi Malone (Elizabeth Berkley), who dreams of becoming a top showgirl, was roundly rejected, with USA Today calling the film “as hoary as it is whore-y.” But, as Sontag notes, “What was banal can, with the passage of time, become fantastic,” and SHOWGIRLS has now been embraced for being “perfectly bad,” and entirely camp. The film’s solemnity set against gaudy Las Vegas, Berkley’s extreme performance, the backstage melodrama of the Stardust Resort and Casino has enshrined SHOWGIRLS as camp canon. Content consideration: contains a scene of sexual assault."
MOMMIE DEAREST,1981,Frank Perry,129,Summer Camp,,USA,In English | Format: Digital,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//mommie-dearest,MOMMIE DEAREST,"In this balls-to-the-wall biopic of Hollywood legend Joan Crawford, Faye Dunaway stars as the formidable actress, who adopts two children and proves to be a nightmarishly abusive parent. Released as a drama, when audiences responded to the film with laughter, Paramount resold MOMMIE DEAREST as a comedy (new posters read “Meet the biggest mother of them all!”). The film and Dunaway’s explosive performance was lambasted—Variety mocked, “Dunaway does not chew scenery, she swallows it whole, costars and all."" Dunaway’s theatricality has been exhaustively parodied, tributed, and embraced—44 years later we’re still shrieking, “No wire hangers!”"
BREWSTER MCCLOUD,1970,Robert Altman,105,Robert Altman Centennial,35mm,USA,In English | Format: 35mm,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//brewster-mccloud,BREWSTER MCCLOUD,"Fresh off the success of M*A*S*H, Altman founded his own production company, Lion’s Gate Films, to give himself creative freedom, delivering a quirky story about Brewster (Bud Cort), an owlish teenager who lives in the basement of the Houston Astrodome, working daily on a pair of wings that he hopes will allow him to fly. After a series of villainous Houstonians are strangled—and continuously shat on by birds—and Brewster is pegged as the suspect, alongside Astrodome tour guide Suzanne (Shelley Duvall, in her debut performance), taking to the sky may be Brewster’s only chance of escape. “I wouldn't say it's my best film,” Altman admitted. “It's flawed, not nearly as finished as some work I've done since, but it's my favorite, because I took more chances then. It was my boldest work, by far my most ambitious. I went way out on a limb to reach for it.”"
BOOM!,1968,Joseph Losey,110,Summer Camp,,UK,In English and Italian with English subtitles | Format: Digital,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//boom,BOOM!,"In the riotous BOOM!, the terminally-ill Flora Goforth (Elizabeth Taylor) is visited at her Capri villa by the mysterious Chris Flanders (Richard Burton) who may be the angel of death. Adapted from a Tennessee Williams play, director John Waters, the film’s biggest fan, calls BOOM!, “The other side of camp. It's beautiful, atrocious, and it's perfect.” The production went wildly over budget, in part due to Taylor’s extravagant costumes, which includes a two-foot tall beaded headdress. Sontag wrote, “Camp is a woman walking around in a dress made of three million feathers.” Instead of feathers, BOOM! went with beads."
42ND STREET,1933,Lloyd Bacom,89,Summer Camp,,USA,In English | Format: Digital,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//42nd-street,42ND STREET,"The Busby Berkeley–choreographed, smash hit musical 42ND STREET may seem misplaced on this list (even blasphemously so, alongside SHOWGIRLS) but in “Notes on Camp,” Sontag singles out the film. “The pure examples of camp are unintentional; they are dead serious. Genuine camp does not mean to be funny.” 42ND STREET, a dazzling backstage story about a Broadway director who mounts one last show before he retires, is steeped in camp sensibility: extravagant production design, sincere melodrama, and earnest spectacle—Berkeley’s calling card."
KING KONG,1933,"Merian C. Cooper, Ernest B. Schoedsack",100,Summer Camp,,USA,In English | Format: Digital,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//king-kong,KING KONG,"In “Notes on Camp,” Sontag provides examples of canonical camp: The National Enquirer, Swan Lake, Flash Gordon comics, and KING KONG. When it was released, there wasn’t a whiff of camp to KING KONG, and audiences marveled at and took seriously its originality. While Sontag writes that time can make the banal fantastic, with KONG, the opposite occurs: Kong’s T-Rex fight on Skull Island, Fay Wray squirming in his massive paw, the ape beating his chest on the top of the Empire State Building—it all reads quite campy now. Still, the final line of the film, which we won’t dare spoil here, is one of the best of the last century."
MCCABE & MRS. MILLER,1971,Robert Altman,120,Robert Altman Centennial,35mm,USA,In English and Cantonese with English subtitles | Format: 35mm,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//mccabe-mrs-miller,MCCABE & MRS. MILLER,"Altman’s revisionist Western stars Warren Beaty as gambler John McCabe and Julie Christie as madam Constance Miller, two newcomers to the town of Presbyterian Church, Washington, in the early 1900s. After they partner up to run a saloon and brothel, their business is threatened by a corporation interested in buying the property. Altman’s layered dialogue style and unorthodox, fluid cinematography radically upended the Western genre. The stakes are high, of course—prosperity, love, death—but here Altman swaps the dusty frontier for the muddy and snowy Pacific Northwest, and trades American patriotism for melancholic isolation. Set to the songs of Leonard Cohen, the film earned Julie Christie an Academy Award nomination and was praised by The New Yorker’s Pauline Kael as being so affecting “it leaves one rather dazed.” Of its director, The Chicago Tribune’s Gene Siskel declared, “Altman is clearly a master.” 35mm print courtesy The Chicago Film Society."
SABBATH QUEEN,2024,Sandi Simcha Dubowski,105,,Director In Attendance,USA,In English and Hebrew and Yiddish with English subtitles | Format: Digital,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//sabbath-queen,SABBATH QUEEN,"Rabbi Amichai Lau-Lavie, a dynastic heir of 38 generations of rabbis, arrives in New York City in the 1990s, a creative young gay man who uses performance art—including appearing in drag as Rebbetzin Hadassah Gross, widow to six rabbis—to challenge patriarchal orthodoxy. Founder of Lab/ Shul, the “god-optional, pop-up, experimental Jewish community,” Lau-Lavie shocks everyone when he decides to become a rabbi himself, studying in the conservative tradition of Judaism so he has the knowledge to challenge the canon from within. Provocative and engaging, SABBATH QUEEN is an exhilarating document of freedom, faith, independence, and individuality. Dialogue: Director Sandi Simcha Dubowski in attendance."
THE DEVIL IS A WOMAN,1935,Josef von Sternberg,79,Summer Camp,35mm,USA,In English and Spanish with English subtitles | Format: 35mm,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//devil-woman,THE DEVIL IS A WOMAN,"When we first see Marlene Dietrich in THE DEVIL IS A WOMAN, she is wearing a towering headdress, in a horse drawn carriage, surrounded by balloons—what an entrance! “Camp is the outrageous aestheticism of von Sternberg’s six American movies with Dietrich,” writes Sontag. In this, their last film together, Dietrich is the notorious seductress Concha to Cesar Romero’s Captain Costelar, who, falling under the temptresses spell, is warned to resist her charms. A veritable feast of baroque décor and opulence, Dietrich’s wardrobe—replete with gowns, massive jewels, and unforgettable hats—is worth the price of admission alone."
IMAGES,1972,Robert Altman,104,Robert Altman Centennial,,UK,In English and French with English subtitles | Format: Digital,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//images,IMAGES,"In Altman’s psychological thriller, the mental undoing of author Cathryn (Susannah York) begins with disturbing phone calls that suggest her husband Hugh is having an affair. Shortly after, Cathryn is plagued by visions of her dead lover Rene, and receives an unexpected visit by her ex-lover Marcel—and soon is unable to distinguish the three men from one another. Critical viewing for Altman devotees and novices alike, IMAGES, which critics compared to Ingmar Bergman’s PERSONA (a major inspiration for the film), is an atypical Altman film, with a small cast of five, no overlapping dialogue, and haunting visuals that marked an entirely new style in his filmography (which he revisits in 1977’s 3 WOMEN, presented in this series July 16 and 19). IMAGES premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, where York won the Best Actress prize. A young John Williams received an Academy Award nomination for his chilling original score."
LIGHTNING,1952,Mikio Naruse,87,,35mm,Japan,In Japanese with English subtitles | Format: Imported 35mm,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//lightning,Chicago Film Society Presents: LIGHTNING,"You've never met a more cheerful urban ambassador than Kiyoko (Hideko Takamine), who works as a tour guide on a bus and spends her days airily comparing the sights and sounds of post-war Tokyo to the old world charms of Paris. From the first moment she’s glimpsed on screen, Kiyoko is obviously living her best life, unencumbered by marriage, children, or professional anxiety—and yet everyone in her family wonders when she’s going to settle down with the right man. Her mother, who’s been married and divorced four times and had a child with each husband, suggests (and suggests and suggests again) the local baker as a suitor with squarely good- enough appeal. Both of Kiyoko’s sisters attest to the pleasures of coupledom, despite much evidence to the contrary. Kiyoko laughs it all off, breezily informing any interlocutor that men are just terrible. (Luckily, she can readily cite the example of her ne’er-do-well brother, with his slovenly, unshaven legs and his meager pachinko parlor winnings.) Adapted from a novel by Fumiko Hayashi, whose hard- scrabble, lower-middle class milieu was brought to the screen six times by Mikio Naruse, LIGHTNING is an unassuming marvel, a work that teeters on the edge of romantic comedy, but never succumbs. Kinema Junpo magazine declared it the second-best Japanese film of 1952, behind only Kurosawa’s IKIRU, but LIGHTNING, along with the rest of Naruse’s post-war output, did not get distributed in the US and remains undeservedly obscure. Like its heroine, LIGHTNING simply engages with the world, avoids shunting its characters into readymade boxes, and looks over the horizon for fleeting release. (Chicago Film Society) 35mm from the Japan Foundation, permission Kadokawa."
