In MATERIALISTS, successful New York City matchmaker Lucy (Dakota Johnson, THE LOST DAUGHTER, SUSPIRIA) finds herself torn between a perfect, good looking, rich new beau, also known as “the impossible fantasy” (Pedro Pascal, GLADIATOR II, Game of Thrones), and John  (Chris Evans, KNIVES OUT, AVENGERS), a lowly caterer with multiple roommates, who also happens to be her imperfect ex.",Siskel,2025-06-25T21:23:19.857608+00:00
IMAGES,1972,Robert Altman,104,Robert Altman Centennial,,UK,In English and French with English subtitles | Format: Digital,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//images,IMAGES,"In Altman’s psychological thriller, the mental undoing of author Cathryn (Susannah York) begins with disturbing phone calls that suggest her husband Hugh is having an affair. Shortly after, Cathryn is plagued by visions of her dead lover Rene, and receives an unexpected visit by her ex-lover Marcel—and soon is unable to distinguish the three men from one another. Critical viewing for Altman devotees and novices alike, IMAGES, which critics compared to Ingmar Bergman’s PERSONA (a major inspiration for the film), is an atypical Altman film, with a small cast of five, no overlapping dialogue, and haunting visuals that marked an entirely new style in his filmography (which he revisits in 1977’s 3 WOMEN, presented in this series July 16 and 19). IMAGES premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, where York won the Best Actress prize. A young John Williams received an Academy Award nomination for his chilling original score.",Siskel,2025-06-25T21:23:19.857608+00:00

LIGHTNING,1952,Mikio Naruse,87,,35mm,Japan,In Japanese with English subtitles | Format: Imported 35mm,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//lightning,Chicago Film Society Presents: LIGHTNING,"You've never met a more cheerful urban ambassador than Kiyoko (Hideko Takamine), who works as a tour guide on a bus and spends her days airily comparing the sights and sounds of post-war Tokyo to the old world charms of Paris. From the first moment she’s glimpsed on screen, Kiyoko is obviously living her best life, unencumbered by marriage, children, or professional anxiety—and yet everyone in her family wonders when she’s going to settle down with the right man. Her mother, who’s been married and divorced four times and had a child with each husband, suggests (and suggests and suggests again) the local baker as a suitor with squarely good- enough appeal. Both of Kiyoko’s sisters attest to the pleasures of coupledom, despite much evidence to the contrary. Kiyoko laughs it all off, breezily informing any interlocutor that men are just terrible. (Luckily, she can readily cite the example of her ne’er-do-well brother, with his slovenly, unshaven legs and his meager pachinko parlor winnings.) Adapted from a novel by Fumiko Hayashi, whose hard- scrabble, lower-middle class milieu was brought to the screen six times by Mikio Naruse, LIGHTNING is an unassuming marvel, a work that teeters on the edge of romantic comedy, but never succumbs. Kinema Junpo magazine declared it the second-best Japanese film of 1952, behind only Kurosawa’s IKIRU, but LIGHTNING, along with the rest of Naruse’s post-war output, did not get distributed in the US and remains undeservedly obscure. Like its heroine, LIGHTNING simply engages with the world, avoids shunting its characters into readymade boxes, and looks over the horizon for fleeting release. (Chicago Film Society) 35mm from the Japan Foundation, permission Kadokawa.",Siskel,2025-06-25T21:23:19.857608+00:00

In FEMALE TROUBLE, Divine stars as Dawn Davenport, a runaway who goes on a nightmarish journey defined by abuse, petty crime, cosmetology, and fame. Waters, aka the “Pope of Trash,” finds extravagance in the filth, which he embraces with all the seriousness camp requires. As Sontag writes, “Camp taste is a kind of love for human nature.

In this, their last film together, Dietrich is the notorious seductress Concha to Cesar Romero’s Captain Costelar, who, falling under the temptresses spell, is warned to resist her charms.

When it was released, there wasn’t a whiff of camp to KING KONG, and audiences marveled at and took seriously its originality. While Sontag writes that time can make the banal fantastic, with KONG, the opposite occurs: Kong’s T-Rex fight on Skull Island, Fay Wray squirming in his massive paw, the ape beating his chest on the top of the Empire State Building—it all reads quite campy now.

Walsh’s authentic script and Altman’s chaotic style give CALIFORNIA SPLIT a manic energy—the poker tables and racetracks come alive with the possibility of a win and the looming threat of loss, and Gould and Segal deliver raw performances in a film that is as much about gambling as it is about their relationship. CALIFORNIA SPLIT recorded eight separate audio channels simultaneously, which allowed Altman to further develop his trademark dialogue style, and gives the film a richer sense of place: every inch of the casino floor hums. One of the 13 films Altman made in the 1970s, CALIFORNIA SPLIT remains a standout in his filmography—an unsentimental look at addiction, and a bittersweet portrait of friendship.",Siskel,2025-06-25T21:23:19.857608+00:00

Kiarostami transforms this seemingly simple errand into an epic hero’s journey, as Ahmed determinedly climbs hills and asks strangers for directions, steadfast in his mission to help his classmate. The first film in Kiarostami’s wonderous Koker Trilogy (followed by AND LIFE GOES ON and THROUGH THE OLIVE TREES), WHERE IS THE FRIEND’S HOUSE? is a delicate and divine fable of altruism, friendship, and kindness, and a gentle reminder that even the smallest of gestures can have an enormous impact. If you haven’t cried happy tears in awhile, this screening should do the trick.",Siskel,2025-06-25T21:23:19.857608+00:00
CHINATOWN,1974,Roman Polanski,130,Spoiler Alert,35mm,USA,"In English, Cantonese, and Spanish with English subtitles | Format: 35mm",https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//chinatown,CHINATOWN,"In this stylish neo-noir, L.A. private detective Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is hired to investigate a case of marital infidelity involving the chief engineer at the Department of Water and Power. When the man in question turns up dead, Gittes uncovers a web of corruption and lies involving the dead man’s wife (Faye Dunaway) and her father (John Huston). Any murder mystery is bound to include a few revelations— that’s no surprise—but in CHINATOWN, as the D.A. warns him, “You think you know what you’re dealing with, but you don’t.” Perhaps more stunning than the film’s most infamous reveal is that, in Chinatown, even when Jake solves the case, he can’t erase the sins of bad men, and there can be no real justice.",Siskel,2025-06-25T21:23:19.857608+00:00

POPEYE,1980,Robert Altman,114,Robert Altman Centennial,35mm,USA,In English | Format: 35mm,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//popeye,POPEYE,"Now regarded as a cult classic and nostalgic favorite, POPEYE was a critical disaster—though a financial success, earning more than double its budget at the box office. Altman’s musical adaptation of E. C. Segar's comic, starring Robin Williams as the titular sailor man and Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl, generally bewildered critics, who couldn’t get “all aboard!” Altman’s vision of Popeye’s adventures searching for his long lost father, falling in love with Olive Oyl, and raising the adopted Swee’ Pee. Newsday likened watching POPEYE to being “trapped in a stalled elevator or a doomed submarine with raving lunatics without fresh air.” Forty-five years on, however, at the core of this eccentric comedy, with its ambitious production design and committed performances by Williams and Duvall, Altman is exploring familiar waters: a story about human behavior. Altman and Popeye aren’t an incongruous pairing: they both yam what they yam. 35mm print courtesy of the Robert Altman Collection at the UCLA Film & Television Archive.",Siskel,2025-06-25T21:23:19.857608+00:00

Tom takes solace in the friendship of a fellow lonely soul, the neglected wife (Deborah Kerr) of the school’s head coach (Leif Erickson), further inflaming the suspicions and insecurities of the men who surround him. Kerr, Kerr, and Erickson all reprised their roles from the 1953 hit Broadway play by Robert Anderson, while Vincente Minnelli took over the directing reins from Elia Kazan.",Siskel,2025-06-25T21:23:19.857608+00:00
LIFE AFTER,2025,Reid Davenport,99,,Director In Attendance,USA,In English | Format: Digital,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//life-after,LIFE AFTER,"In the follow-up to his acclaimed, award-winning debut feature I DIDN’T SEE YOU THERE, Reid Davenport’s LIFE AFTER is a gripping investigation of the tangled web of moral dilemmas and profit motives surrounding assisted dying. “This film is not about suicide,” Davenport explains, as he sets out to tell the story of Elizabeth Bouvia, a disabled woman who sought the “right to die” in 1983 and ignited a national debate about the autonamy and value of disabled lives. Connecting Bouvia’s story to his own as a disabled person, Davenport uncovers shocking abuses of power while amplifying the voices of the disability community fighting for justice and dignity in an unfolding matter of life and death. LIFE AFTER brings together the missing voices of the disability community in the ongoing debate about assisted dying, uncovering chilling stories of disabled people dying prematurely. Davenport exposes the intersection of systemic failures and personal autonomy, challenging the idea that assisted dying always represents a free choice, when it can sometimes be seen as the only option. Content consideration: includes themes of assisted suicide, institutionalization, and the death of disabled people. Director Reid Davenport in attendance for a post screening discussion moderated by Cassidy Dimon, Executive Director of FWD-Doc.",Siskel,2025-06-25T21:23:19.857608+00:00

When he falls in love with lonely trapeze artist Marion, the angel considers (with some guidance from Peter Falk, playing himself) giving up his immortality to be with her. A love letter to Berlin, to cinema, and to love itself, WINGS OF DESIRE brings heartache and longing to spectacular life.

Altman made a deal with the stage producer to retain the original cast (Karen Black, Cher, Sandy Dennis, Kathy Bates) and the set, which included two-way mirrors, and allowed the camera to transition from present to past as the women recall the last two decades of their lives. COME BACK… had its U.S. premiere on September 30, 1982 (the anniversary of James Dean’s death) at the Chicago International Film Festival, where it received a 10 minute standing ovation.

BODY HEAT,1981,Lawrence Kasdan,113,Scorchers,35mm,USA,In English | Format: 35mm,https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org//body-heat,BODY HEAT,"“You can stand here with me if you want, but you have to agree not to talk about the heat.” Thus begins the intense affair between attorney Ned Racine (William Hurt) and “well-tended” wife Matty Walker (Kathleen Turner). As Ned falls hard for Matty, she tells him about her unhappy marriage to her wealthy husband, and the two hatch a plot to murder him and claim his fortune. Blinded by lust, Ned begins to realize that he’s one step behind what he thought was a perfect crime. Set against a sweltering Florida summer, Lawrence Kasdan’s BODY HEAT is a classic erotic drama of the 1980s (even if it was set in winter, Hurt and Turner’s chemistry would be red hot), and an homage to film noir, replete with a jazzy score and a barn-burner of a twist ending.",Siskel,2025-06-25T21:23:19.857608+00:00
