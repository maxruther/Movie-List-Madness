CHINATOWN,1974,Roman Polanski,ReelViews,100,James Berardinelli,"A nearly flawless example of movie composition, with close examination revealing how carefully it was put together. For those who take a less studious and more visceral approach to movie viewing, it's also worth noting that Chinatown is a superior thriller - one that will keep viewers involved and ""in the moment"" until the final, mournful scene has come to a conclusion.",
CHINATOWN,1974,Roman Polanski,Chicago Sun-Times,100,Roger Ebert,"[Nicholson's] performance is key in keeping Chinatown from becoming just a genre crime picture--that, and a Robert Towne screenplay that evokes an older Los Angeles, a small city in a large desert.",

Polanski brilliantly shows that money and power are not what's motivating everyone after all. There's a lower stratum of sexual dysfunction and fear at work, which is difficult, if not impossible to understand:: the ultimate meaning of the chaotic ""Chinatown"" of the title. Unmissable.",

CHINATOWN,1974,Roman Polanski,The New Yorker,80,Pauline Kael,"The film holds you, in a suffocating way. Polanski never lets the story tell itself.

And yet the nastiness has a look, and a fascination.",
CHINATOWN,1974,Roman Polanski,The New York Times,70,Vincent Canby,"Mr. Polanski and Mr. Towne attempted nothing so witty and entertaining, being content instead to make a competently stylish, more or less thirites-ish movie that continually made me wish I were back seeing ""The Maltese Falcon"" or ""The Big Sleep.""

POPEYE,1980,Robert Altman,Time Out London,90,Geoff Andrew,"With Williams giving a virtuoso fast-mumbling performance as the hero, and gags ranging from expertly choreographed slapstick to subtle verbal infelicities (Popeye muttering about 'venerable disease'), it is far too sophisticated to function merely as kids' fodder. Often, watching the actors contorting themselves into non-human shapes, you wonder how on earth Altman did it; equally often, you feel you are watching a wacky masterpiece, the like of which you've never seen before.",

POPEYE,1980,Robert Altman,Chicago Tribune,88,Gene Siskel,"A charming, adult-oriented saga of the famous cartoon character that comes alive only when Popeye finds his baby, Swee'pea. [19 Dec 1980, p.10]",
POPEYE,1980,Robert Altman,Slant Magazine,88,Eric Henderson,Altman directs the complex web of social interactions with a frame that’s both inclusive and prying. And the actors he collected and dropped in Malta’s simulated community help evoke an atmosphere that is genial yet guarded. Shelly Duvall couldn’t possibly have played Olive Oyl badly.,
POPEYE,1980,Robert Altman,The Dissolve,80,Scott Tobias,"Even the flaws mesh with the overall fabric of the film in a way that impeccably choreographed musical numbers and fight scenes might not have. Altman reverses the emphasis of most mainstream family entertainments, which are about pace and snap, and instead favors a gentle, more inviting evocation of Sweethaven and its oddball inhabitants. Robert Evans wanted an answer to the Broadway hit Annie. Instead, he got a Robert Altman film.",
POPEYE,1980,Robert Altman,Boston Globe,75,Bruce McCabe,"One of the major problems facing Hollywood today is the lack of will and energy to make movies that can charm youngsters without boring their parents. Popeye is an important contribution toward the solution. It's not a sophisticated film. But it's a gratifyingly engaging one. [12 Dec 1980, p.1]",
POPEYE,1980,Robert Altman,Washington Post,70,Judith Martin,"Considering how firmly the image of Popeye is fixed in the minds of all spinach-bred Americans, it's daring of the film to open by showing the character in its familiar cartoon form. But Robin Williams so utterly captures the Popeye idea as to justify this, and Shelley Duvall is such a perfect Olive Oyl that it will always be difficult to imagine her impersonating a human being.

POPEYE,1980,Robert Altman,The New Yorker,60,Pauline Kael,"The picture doesn't come together and much of it is cluttered, squawky, and eerily unfunny.

POPEYE,1980,Robert Altman,Variety,50,Staff (Not Credited),"It is more than faint praise to say that Popeye is far, far better than it might have been, considering the treacherous challenge it presented. But avoiding disaster is not necessarily the same as success.",
POPEYE,1980,Robert Altman,Chicago Reader,50,Dave Kehr,"Robert Altman's busy, detailed mise-en-scene, flattened cartoon-style through space-compacting long lenses, does capture some of the frenetic atmosphere of the Fleischer cartoons, but it tends to crowd out, and neutralize, the story values.",
POPEYE,1980,Robert Altman,Newsweek,50,David Ansen,"This is high-risk chemistry, and the results are bizarre. The bulging forearms and corncob pipe are in place, but this Popeye hates spinach. The plot hinges on his Oedipal search for his Pappy (Ray Walston), the songs and minimal dances are designed for singers who can't sing and dancers who can't dance, and this gruff icon of pug nacious, all-American goodness has been set adrift on an abstract isle that can perhaps best be described as backlot Ionesco. Popeye's air of alienated whimsy makes for an odd family movie indeed. [22 Dec 1980, p.72]",
POPEYE,1980,Robert Altman,TV Guide Magazine,40,Staff (Not Credited),"The film's real star is its magnificent set (filmed and constructed in Malta), though Williams manages to screw up his face and eye in a credible imitation of the drawings, and Duvall is perfect as the gangly Olive Oyl.",
POPEYE,1980,Robert Altman,The Globe and Mail (Toronto),25,Jay Scott,"A shamelessly commercial and determinedly vulgar director, such as Flash Gordon's Mike Hodges, might have made the film work; it might have succeeded on one level instead of failing on many. [13 Dec 1980, p.E7]",
WHISPER OF THE HEART,1995,Yoshifumi Kondô,ReelViews,88,James Berardinelli,"An affecting and endearing collaboration between Miyazaki and Kondo, it weds a coming-of-age story with a flight of fancy to good effect.

PSYCHO,1960,Alfred Hitchcock,Chicago Sun-Times,100,Roger Ebert,"What makes Psycho immortal, when so many films are already half-forgotten as we leave the theater, is that it connects directly with our fears: Our fears that we might impulsively commit a crime, our fears of the police, our fears of becoming the victim of a madman, and of course our fears of disappointing our mothers.",
PSYCHO,1960,Alfred Hitchcock,The Telegraph,100,Mark Monahan,"Hitchcock's mischievous genius for audience manipulation is everywhere: in the noirish angularity of the cinematography, in his use of Bernard Herrmann's stabbing string score, in the ornithological imagery that creates a bizarre sense of preying and being preyed upon.",
PSYCHO,1960,Alfred Hitchcock,Slant Magazine,100,Bill Weber,"Felt in the full impact of a theatrical screening (with the pleasure of seeing patrons reflexively kick or stiffen at the sight of Miles startled by her mirrored reflection), its power is not just that of a showman’s calibrated scare machine, but of a somber fugue on the trapped 20th-century creatures who inhabit its world, clawing but never budging an inch.",

PSYCHO,1960,Alfred Hitchcock,Village Voice,100,Andrew Sarris,"Psycho should be seen at least three times by any discerning film-goer, the first time for the sheer terror of the experience, and on this occasion I fully agree with Hitchcock that only a congenital spoilsport would reveal the plot; the second time for the macabre comedy inherent in the conception of the film; and the third for all the hidden meanings and symbols lurking beneath the surface of the first American movie since “Touch of Evil” to stand in the same creative rank as the great European films.

Marlene Dietrich is also excellent as the accused's wife.",
WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION,1957,Billy Wilder,Chicago Reader,75,Dave Kehr,"The artificial plotting is all Christie’s, but the film eventually becomes Wilder’s—thanks to a trick ending that dovetails nicely with a characteristic revelation of compassion behind cruelty.

Underlying the hard-bitten surface is a slightly uncomfortable allegory which identifies Newman as a Christ figure. But this scarcely detracts from the brilliantly idiosyncratic script (by Donn Pearce from his own novel) or from Conrad Hall's glittering camerawork (which survives Rosenberg's penchant for the zoom lens and shots reflected in sun-glasses).",
