These include video essays, diaries, and documentation of the fight against the AIDS epidemic, struggles to free political prisoners, and anti-imperialist movements. Often assembled from the fragments of everyday life—newspaper clippings, letters, snapshots, half-remembered conversations, found objects, and other ephemera—these works embody Patten’s project to face as well as fictionalize her “checkered biography” and its contradictory entanglements between the call to respond to political urgencies and the desire to live an “artist’s life.” Followed by a conversation with the artist."
