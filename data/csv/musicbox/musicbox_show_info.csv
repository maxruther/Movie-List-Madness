Anchored by Pavement’s slacker-sage-sphinx, Stephen Malkmus, the film features performances by Joe Keery, Jason Schwartzman, Tim Heidecker, and Zoe Lister-Jones.",https://musicboxtheatre.com/films-and-events/pavements,Music Box,2025-06-25T21:23:52.470408+00:00

But when Karli’s father offers her a little money and a one-way ticket to New York, she finally sees a way out of her dead-end life—that is, until the money goes missing, kickstarting a final night out on the town that none of them will ever forget. With a screenplay written by and based on the lives of two of its stars, performances from local Sydney bands Pel Mel and the Dynamic Hepnotics, and supporting appearances by a handful of beloved Ozploitation regulars—including David Argue (BMX Bandits) and Hugh Keays-Byrne (Mad Max)—Haydn Keenan’s debut feature Going Down is an underseen landmark of Australian cinema and a vivid portrait of Sydney in the early ’80s. Existing somewhere between Susan Seidelman’s Smithereens and Juliet Berto and Jean-Henri Roger’s Neige in its depictions of the thrills and dangers of urban life, Going Down is a visceral testament to friendship and making it at any cost.",https://musicboxtheatre.com/films-and-events/going-down,Music Box,2025-06-25T21:23:52.470408+00:00

A STORY OF FLOATING WEEDS,1934,86,35mm,Yasujirô Ozu,"Takeshi Sakamoto, Chôko Iida, Kôji Mitsui","Tadao Ikeda, Yasujirô Ozu","Early in his career, Japanese filmmaker Yasujirō Ozu regularly channelled the snappy verve of American commercial cinema, name-checking Ernst Lubitsch and Harold Lloyd and fashioning transpacific translations of gangster films and melodramas. (In the fanciful world of silent Ozu, everyone is a cinephile with a Hollywood sweet tooth, with posters for Our Dancing Daughters and The Champ hanging in office buildings and apartments.) Even A Story of Floating Weeds, an understated and seemingly culturally-specific account of a kabuki ensemble touring the Japanese countryside, was inspired by the 1928 carnival drama The Barker from American studio First National. In Ozu’s version, Kihachi (Takeshi Sakamoto) leads a band of actors eking out sustenance and little more, cheerfully trouping through provincial theaters with leaky roofs. When they arrive by train at a quiet town in the mountains, Kihachi seeks out Otsune (Chôko Iida), the mother of the son he fathered on a tour many years ago. The son, Shinkichi (Kôji Mitsui), believes that Kihachi is his long-absent but fun-loving uncle, good for a fishing lesson and nothing more. When Kihachi’s lover Otaka (Emiko Yagumo), a fellow actor, learns of his clandestine meetings with Otsune, she orchestrates a plot to smoke out his secret passions. This simple, beautifully spare narrative demonstrated Ozu’s evolving craftsmanship and pointed the way towards a more idiosyncratic style that left familiar genre tropes, Hollywood or otherwise, far behind. The sturdy perfection of Ozu’s new style was confirmed a quarter century later when he remade the film as Floating Weeds, which, despite the addition of sound, color, and a seaside locale, repeated many of the same shots, gestures, and jokes with undiminished impact.",https://musicboxtheatre.com/films-and-events/a-story-of-floating-weeds,Music Box,2025-06-25T21:23:52.470408+00:00

A look at the darkness beneath the seductive lifestyles of Rome’s rich and glamorous, the film follows a notorious celebrity journalist (a sublimely cool Marcello Mastroianni) during a hectic week spent on the peripheries of the spotlight. This mordant picture was an incisive commentary on the deepening decadence of contemporary Europe, and it provided a prescient glimpse of just how gossip- and fame-obsessed our society would become.

As though passing into a dream, the charismatic avatar finds himself initiated into a phantasmagoric world where women--or an idea of women--have taken power, and which is structured like an array of psychosexual set-pieces, culminating in a bravura hot-air balloon that decisively sticks the ""anti"" up into ""climax.""",https://musicboxtheatre.com/films-and-events/city-of-women,Music Box,2025-06-25T21:23:52.470408+00:00

Spendo, on the edge of suicide, relives her life, reconstructs it and, finally, liberates herself. Sadness flows and fills the space. The hours coexist and intertwine. The world: a flesh-eating mechanism. A descend begins, a rhythmic immersion into the depths of memory, where evil appears in the form of good. Until memory no longer repeats itself; a new viewpoint sneaks in. The hours are noiselessly formed anew. Violent dependence is left in the past.Antoinetta Angelidi (b. 1950) is a pioneering Greek filmmaker and visual artist whose works regularly distance viewers from reality “in order to reach out to the Real.” Her feminist, surreal movies pull from both her dreams and art history, regularly inverting codes and employing multiple narratives. Her 1995 masterwork The Hours: A Square Film (1995) is a deeply autobiographical film that alludes to a traumatic experience she had as a child. Angelidi considers it “the final product of a long, unsuccessful psychoanalysis… When it was finished, I felt redeemed.”",https://musicboxtheatre.com/films-and-events/the-hours-a-square-film,Music Box,2025-06-25T21:23:52.470408+00:00

AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATION MAN OF MYSTERY,1997,89,35mm,Jay Roach,"Mike Myers, Elizabeth Hurley, Mike Myers, Michael York, Seth Green",Mike Myers,"Before it reached total pop culture saturation, there was the film that started it all: AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY! Made on a thrifty budget of $16.5 million, what initially seemed destined to be a minor cult hit quickly became a worldwide phenomenon. And with good reason: It’s hysterical. Mike Myers gives two instantly iconic performances: Austin Powers, the grooviest spy of the swinging 60s who is forced to reckon with the politics and cynicism of the 90s, and Dr. Evil, his folically-challenged, power-hungry, cat-fancying nemesis.  Taking influence from not only James Bond, but Harry Palmer, The Beatles, Blake Edwards, and BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS (Which may have contributed to it receiving “Two Thumbs Up” by Siskel & Ebert!), AUSTIN POWERS is an effective time capsule of two bygone eras, the late 60s and the late 90s.

PIERROT LE FOU,1965,110,35mm,Jean-Luc Godard,"Jean-Paul Belmondo, Anna Karina, Graziella Galvani","Rémo Forlani, Jean-Luc Godard, Lionel White","Given the half-century or so of his career spent bouncing between televisual experiments, incendiary collectivist agitprop, and narrative ruminations on the fractured state of culture, it can be easy to overlook that for a few years in the 1960s Jean-Luc Godard was considered a bankable box office prospect. The director’s 1964 announcement of his forthcoming adaptation of Lionel White’s crime novel Obsession gave little sense for how far afield he was about to stray from the era’s commercial cinema. By the time the cameras were scheduled to roll on Pierrot le fou, Godard still had no concrete plans for the production beyond a handful of scheduled location shoots and a cast which included Jean-Paul Belmondo and Godard’s ex-wife Anna Karina as the leads. Ostensibly guided by the source novel’s plot, in which a middle-class father abandons his family to pursue a relationship with their criminally-connected babysitter, Godard and his collaborators made the film up as they shot it, taking inspiration from the era’s political upheavals, Godard’s own personal and professional crises, and, inevitably, the films and art the director loved. The result is as unconventional as its technique, careening through a series of episodes between the unfortunate lovers Marianne (Karina) and Ferdinand (Belmondo) in which they petulantly argue about romance and philosophy, perform lo-fi musical production numbers, accumulate a menagerie of exotic pets, pantomime the colonial occupation of Vietnam, and, in a climax which inspired a 15-year-old Chantal Akerman to (cinematically) blow up her town, explode.Preceded by: “Duck Amuck” (Chuck Jones, 1953) – 7 min – 35mm",https://musicboxtheatre.com/films-and-events/pierrot-le-fou,Music Box,2025-06-25T21:23:52.470408+00:00

Their encounters are formal and polite—until a discovery about their spouses creates an intimate bond between them. At once delicately mannered and visually extravagant, Wong Kar Wai’s IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE is a masterful evocation of romantic longing and fleeting moments. With its aching musical soundtrack and exquisitely abstract cinematography by Christopher Doyle and Mark Lee Ping-bin, this film has been a major stylistic influence on the past 25 years of cinema.Presented with the short film IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE 2001Initially conceived as one third of a triptych about food, IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE was expanded into a stand-alone feature that won immediate recognition as a modern-day classic. Another third—intended as the “dessert,” as Wong Kar Wai has put it—was, until now, only screened during his masterclass at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival. Now available in wide release for the first time, IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE 2001 demonstrates the director’s masterful ability to generate palpable atmosphere and striking characterizations on a miniature canvas—with IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE stars Tony Leung Chiu Wai and Maggie Cheung Man Yuk once again providing the sizzling chemistry— evoking the mystery of transient, unexpected connections in the modern city through his inimitable romantic touch.In Cantonese with English subtitles",https://musicboxtheatre.com/films-and-events/in-the-mood-for-love,Music Box,2025-07-16T16:11:39.293484+00:00

Bressan Jr. (Gay USA) created this indie masterpiece in 1985, which was the first feature-length drama about AIDS. When 25 year-old gay yuppie David (David Schachter) volunteers to be a ""buddy"" to an AIDS patient, the gay community center assigns him to Robert (Geoff Edholm), a 32 year-old politically impassioned gay California gardener abandoned by his friends and lovers. Revolving around the confines of Robert's Manhattan hospital room, Bressan skillfully unfolds this devastating two-hander (the rest of the cast is only heard offscreen). As David gazes out at the piers and rooftops of Manhattan, we hear his deftly scripted diary entries in voiceover. And as David is changed by knowing Robert, so, too, are we.

EARTH,1930,75,35mm,Aleksandr Dovzhenko,"Stepan Shkurat, Semyon Svashenko, Yuliya Solntseva",Aleksandr Dovzhenko,"An old man dies, a baby is born, and still the wind ripples through the apple trees. The ancient, quasi-mystical connection between a people and their soil has been torn asunder: a tractor brings hope for a better way of life to the countryside, but the landed gentry oppose any challenge to their power. The kulaks orchestrate the murder of a young agitator, whose death sends the peasantry into a paroxysm of revolutionary rage and psychosexual fury. Seemingly inventing principles of montage and poetic embellishment that remain obscure and almost supernatural, Earth more than earns its lofty title, merging the cosmic and the quotidian. Alexander Dovzhenko’s final silent film, produced by Ukrainian studio VUKFU to spread the good news of agricultural collectivization and modernization under Stalin’s first Five-Year Plan, has been celebrated, lambasted, and misunderstood from every possible angle over the last century. Was Dovzhenko striking a blow for Ukrainian nationalism and advocating for the folkways of a culture being plowed under by totalizing Soviet homogeneity — or was he putting a shine on ghoulish propaganda for a system that would soon result in widespread famine? Soviet censors denounced Earth as “counter-revolutionary” and “defeatist,” mandating extensive cuts, and curtailing the release. (Amusingly, the British Communist critic Ivor Mantagu dismissed any non-dogmatic interpretation of Earth: “Pantheism? No. Nature worship? Not at all. Sound Marxist dialectic: the union of opposites.”) Dovzhenko’s film remains unclassifiable, a dispatch from a society uprooting itself but clinging strenuously to its mythic inheritance. 35mm from George Eastman Museum",https://musicboxtheatre.com/films-and-events/earth,Music Box,2025-07-16T16:11:39.293484+00:00

EARTH,1930,75,35mm,Aleksandr Dovzhenko,"Stepan Shkurat, Semyon Svashenko, Yuliya Solntseva",Aleksandr Dovzhenko,"An old man dies, a baby is born, and still the wind ripples through the apple trees. The ancient, quasi-mystical connection between a people and their soil has been torn asunder: a tractor brings hope for a better way of life to the countryside, but the landed gentry oppose any challenge to their power. The kulaks orchestrate the murder of a young agitator, whose death sends the peasantry into a paroxysm of revolutionary rage and psychosexual fury. Seemingly inventing principles of montage and poetic embellishment that remain obscure and almost supernatural, Earth more than earns its lofty title, merging the cosmic and the quotidian. Alexander Dovzhenko’s final silent film, produced by Ukrainian studio VUKFU to spread the good news of agricultural collectivization and modernization under Stalin’s first Five-Year Plan, has been celebrated, lambasted, and misunderstood from every possible angle over the last century. Was Dovzhenko striking a blow for Ukrainian nationalism and advocating for the folkways of a culture being plowed under by totalizing Soviet homogeneity — or was he putting a shine on ghoulish propaganda for a system that would soon result in widespread famine? Soviet censors denounced Earth as “counter-revolutionary” and “defeatist,” mandating extensive cuts, and curtailing the release. (Amusingly, the British Communist critic Ivor Mantagu dismissed any non-dogmatic interpretation of Earth: “Pantheism? No. Nature worship? Not at all. Sound Marxist dialectic: the union of opposites.”) Dovzhenko’s film remains unclassifiable, a dispatch from a society uprooting itself but clinging strenuously to its mythic inheritance. 35mm from George Eastman Museum",https://musicboxtheatre.com/films-and-events/earth,Music Box,2025-07-19T03:20:44.467214+00:00

It’s beautiful, confounding, filled with extraordinary music, images, and color, boring at times, mind-blowing at others, kinda long, and completely unforgettable. It has an overture, an entr'acte, an intermission, and our projectionists have a page-long set of instructions so they know when to dim the lights and open the curtain at exactly the right moment. Reports from a screening in Los Angeles when the film opened alleged that an audience member ran through the screen yelling, “It’s God! It’s God!” Please do not do this, even though you may feel inspired to.",https://musicboxtheatre.com/films-and-events/2001-a-space-odyssey,Music Box,2025-07-19T03:20:44.467214+00:00
