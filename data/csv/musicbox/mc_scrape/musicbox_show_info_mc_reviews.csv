EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,Washington Post,100,Ty Burr,"Eephus belongs with the great baseball movies not because of any major league ambitions but because it understands what the game has meant and still means in small towns, among average people and weekend players.","Mar 13, 2025"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,IndieWire,91,Christian Zilko,"The film’s only villain is the passage of time, and its protagonists are simply facing the unpleasant realization that their era is ending sooner than their lifespans.","May 21, 2024"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,Variety,90,Jessica Kiang,"Its pearls of practical wisdom and jewels of melancholic wit make Eephus a gem, which is fitting, for a movie about a game played on a diamond.","May 21, 2024"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,The Daily Beast,90,Nick Schager,"Modest and moving, it’s a new sports-movie classic, as sneakily effective as the pitch which gives it its title.","Mar 6, 2025"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,The New York Times,90,Alissa Wilkinson,"It dwells in some languid liminal space between hangout movie and elegy, a tribute to the community institutions that hold us together, that introduce us to one another and that, in an age of optimized life choices and disappearing public spaces, are slowly fading away.","Mar 6, 2025"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,New York Magazine (Vulture),90,Bilge Ebiri,"Slowly but surely, you settle into its gentle rhythms, and before you know it, it feels like an entire lifetime has passed by.","Mar 9, 2025"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,The Atlantic,90,David Sims,"Eephus is an elegy, but with just the barest hint of sentimentality—a shrugging send-off that simultaneously cares deeply about America’s pastime.","Mar 14, 2025"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,Los Angeles Times,90,Robert Abele,Maybe the most rewarding quality Eephus displays as a first-ballot hall of fame sports movie is the dedication of Lund and company to just being what they are: no-nonsense celebrants of something ephemeral yet enduring.,"Mar 14, 2025"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,Austin Chronicle,89,Kimberley Jones,"Sharing some of the same talent behind last year’s microindie critic’s darling Christmas Eve in Miller’s Point, Eephus is suffused with a sincere love for baseball but not overburdened with holiness about the game.","Mar 20, 2025"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,The Film Stage,83,Jordan Raup,"With a gentle yet rigorous vision, Eephus coalesces into a reflective study of nostalgia: both for a game that has evolved and for a certain kind of American social life that is dwindling as fast as the sun fades.","May 21, 2024"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,Screen Daily,80,Tim Grierson,"Baseball is just a game, but Lund recognises why some need it so badly. On the diamond, these ageing men feel young again – if only for a few hours.","May 21, 2024"

EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,The New Yorker,80,Richard Brody,"In presenting the game, Lund develops a passionately analytical aesthetic of baseball that offers a corrective to the way it’s usually depicted. His documentary-based method, in rejecting the patterned routines of television coverage, intensifies the drama of the sport itself.","Mar 7, 2025"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,Slate,80,Dan Kois,It’s all so pleasantly familiar I might as well have been hanging out with these guys for years.,"Mar 7, 2025"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,Paste Magazine,76,Brianna Zigler,"The “Eephus” pitch is an apt characterization for the film that now shares its name, an odd, surprising story about a baseball game with seemingly little to no stakes, that continues on for long after it should’ve already ended.","Oct 2, 2024"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,Slant Magazine,75,Jake Cole,"Carson Lund treats the power of a shared interest with profound, elegiac empathy.","Jul 2, 2024"

EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,Chicago Tribune,75,Michael Phillips,"Places come; places go. Every human being deals with loss differently. “Eephus” acknowledges that, but it’s a sweet, sidewinding paradox of a sports movie: sentimental in a quietly unsentimental and offhandedly comic fashion.","Mar 20, 2025"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,The Hollywood Reporter,70,Jordan Mintzer,"Eephus isn’t exactly a baseball movie — it’s something closer to movie-baseball, where characters endlessly jostle back and forth under no real time constraints, watching the day slowly pass them by, simply out of love for the sport.","May 21, 2024"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,RogerEbert.com,63,Peyton Robinson,"The pacing works referentially to its namesake and real-time ambition, but the characters aren’t quite interesting or engaging enough to sustain attention for the whole runtime, and the film’s crawl eventually wears on weary knees.","Mar 7, 2025"
THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,New York Post,100,Johnny Oleksinski,"Directed by James Griffiths, this is the sort of hilarious heart-warmer that only comes around once or twice a year to offer a blessed break from darkness, snobbery and streaming schlock. It’s so easy to love, even if love doesn’t come easy for its characters.","Jan 30, 2025"
THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,Christian Science Monitor,100,Peter Rainer,"The Ballad of Wallis Island is both modest and magical. One of its co-stars, Carey Mulligan, has described its tone as a “gentle euphoria.” That phrase perfectly expresses how this wonderful movie – directed by James Griffiths from a script by Tom Basden and Tim Key – transports us.","Mar 26, 2025"
THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,The Associated Press,100,Lindsey Bahr,"The Ballad of Wallis Island is the kind movie that makes it all look so easy — filmmaking, performance, mood, chemistry.

THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,Los Angeles Times,100,Amy Nicholson,"I’d call “Wallis Island” a contender for the most quotable film of the year but there are so many good lines stacked on top of each other, and so much giggling on top of that, it’s impossible to keep up with Key’s wordplay.","Mar 28, 2025"
THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,Variety,90,Tomris Laffly,"Alive with plenty of droll British humor and with a music-filled, picturesque finale that is sincerely earned, The Ballad of Wallis Island is the best kind of crowd-pleaser: disarming, joyful and full of compassion for its oddball characters. This Sundance charmer doesn’t hit a false note.","Jan 28, 2025"
THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,Wall Street Journal,90,Kyle Smith,"Directed by James Griffiths, “Wallis Island” is warm, endearing and very funny, a quintessential indie smile-maker about nice, humble people adorably stumbling their way toward a little happiness.","Mar 27, 2025"

THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,Collider,80,Anna Miller,"Distancing itself from clichés in the name of honesty and earnestness, the charming British dramedy showcases the whole gamut of human relationships but takes tender care to highlight the good. The performances are delightfully honest, its cinematography is visually stunning and immersive, and the tale it tells is one of forgiveness and letting go – one that highlights the power of being gentle to one another.","Feb 6, 2025"
THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,The Film Stage,75,Kent M. Wilhelm,"The Ballad of Wallis Island doesn’t deliver any revelatory perspective on the idea of moving on, nor is it trying to. It’s a crowd-pleasing adult comedy that manages to be sentimental without being cloying, sweet without being saccharine.","Jan 27, 2025"
THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,IndieWire,75,Kate Erbland,"The result is a cozy crowdpleaser with real heart and some lovely songs, and one that doesn’t trade honesty for predictable beats.","Jan 27, 2025"

THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,Slant Magazine,75,Derek Smith,"The Ballad of Wallis Island plays both its drama and comedy in decidedly minor keys, straining neither for grand emotional revelations nor big laughs.","Mar 8, 2025"
THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,Observer,75,Oliver Jones,"A carefully considered mix of humor and melancholy glows in the fragile sunshine that bathes an isolated Welsh coastline in The Ballad of Wallis Island, a wan yet affecting consideration of lost love, forgotten bands and the odd ways those entities manifest themselves in our hearts and on our turntables.","Mar 28, 2025"

THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,Screen Rant,70,Graeme Guttmann,"The Ballad of Wallis Island is effortless in its execution and breezy in its pacing, which makes its emotional undertones all the more surprising and affecting.","Jan 27, 2025"
THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,The A.V. Club,67,Jacob Oller,"This fable’s push to meet, then fix, your heroes can still sound as saccharine as a solo acoustic set, but it’s smart enough to undercut itself early and often.","Mar 26, 2025"
THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,The New York Times,50,Jeannette Catsoulis,"Bereft of chuckles or even a substantial story, this maudlin musical fable never escapes the drag of a lead character with supporting-player energy.","Mar 27, 2025"
THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,TheWrap,30,Chase Hutchinson,"It’s a cute premise that ultimately gets wrung so dry that you’re left waiting for it to finally stop. The majority of its jokes either land flat or are run into the ground. Even worse, it pulls on the heartstrings with such force and impatience that the audience manipulation is palpable in every painfully predictable scene.","Jan 27, 2025"

TWIN PEAKS: FIRE WALK WITH ME,1992,David Lynch,Boston Globe,25,Jay Carr,"Mostly, though, Lynch fills the screen with a lot of cynically off-putting and sadistic violence. In place of incident, character and a bemused view of small-town life, corrupt beneath its cherry-pie surface, we are essentially asked to witness torture - mostly of Laura Palmer, as her troubles lead her to self-destruct with drugs and promiscuity, including a couple of side trips to the Canadian bordello known as One-Eyed Jacks. For all the violence in Lynch's ""Blue Velvet,"" that film maintained a comic dimension. The violence in ""Wild at Heart,"" for all its extravagance of gesture, was hollow - stylized, not real...Here, there's no comedy, nothing surreal, just wave after wave of titillation. Except that it doesn't titillate. It depresses. There's no psychic charge on any of it. It proceeds from no artistic conviction, just from a cynical desire to squeeze a few more bucks from the already overworked corpse of Laura Palmer. It shows how quickly a creative impulse can be exhausted - from quirky originality toying with humanity's darker impulses to dispirited quasi-porn. [29 Aug 1992, p.23]",
