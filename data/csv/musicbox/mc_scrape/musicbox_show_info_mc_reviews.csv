EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,Washington Post,100,Ty Burr,"Eephus belongs with the great baseball movies not because of any major league ambitions but because it understands what the game has meant and still means in small towns, among average people and weekend players.","Mar 13, 2025"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,IndieWire,91,Christian Zilko,"The film’s only villain is the passage of time, and its protagonists are simply facing the unpleasant realization that their era is ending sooner than their lifespans.","May 21, 2024"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,Variety,90,Jessica Kiang,"Its pearls of practical wisdom and jewels of melancholic wit make Eephus a gem, which is fitting, for a movie about a game played on a diamond.","May 21, 2024"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,The Daily Beast,90,Nick Schager,"Modest and moving, it’s a new sports-movie classic, as sneakily effective as the pitch which gives it its title.","Mar 6, 2025"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,The New York Times,90,Alissa Wilkinson,"It dwells in some languid liminal space between hangout movie and elegy, a tribute to the community institutions that hold us together, that introduce us to one another and that, in an age of optimized life choices and disappearing public spaces, are slowly fading away.","Mar 6, 2025"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,New York Magazine (Vulture),90,Bilge Ebiri,"Slowly but surely, you settle into its gentle rhythms, and before you know it, it feels like an entire lifetime has passed by.","Mar 9, 2025"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,The Atlantic,90,David Sims,"Eephus is an elegy, but with just the barest hint of sentimentality—a shrugging send-off that simultaneously cares deeply about America’s pastime.","Mar 14, 2025"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,Los Angeles Times,90,Robert Abele,Maybe the most rewarding quality Eephus displays as a first-ballot hall of fame sports movie is the dedication of Lund and company to just being what they are: no-nonsense celebrants of something ephemeral yet enduring.,"Mar 14, 2025"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,Austin Chronicle,89,Kimberley Jones,"Sharing some of the same talent behind last year’s microindie critic’s darling Christmas Eve in Miller’s Point, Eephus is suffused with a sincere love for baseball but not overburdened with holiness about the game.","Mar 20, 2025"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,The Film Stage,83,Jordan Raup,"With a gentle yet rigorous vision, Eephus coalesces into a reflective study of nostalgia: both for a game that has evolved and for a certain kind of American social life that is dwindling as fast as the sun fades.","May 21, 2024"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,Screen Daily,80,Tim Grierson,"Baseball is just a game, but Lund recognises why some need it so badly. On the diamond, these ageing men feel young again – if only for a few hours.","May 21, 2024"

EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,The New Yorker,80,Richard Brody,"In presenting the game, Lund develops a passionately analytical aesthetic of baseball that offers a corrective to the way it’s usually depicted. His documentary-based method, in rejecting the patterned routines of television coverage, intensifies the drama of the sport itself.","Mar 7, 2025"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,Slate,80,Dan Kois,It’s all so pleasantly familiar I might as well have been hanging out with these guys for years.,"Mar 7, 2025"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,Paste Magazine,76,Brianna Zigler,"The “Eephus” pitch is an apt characterization for the film that now shares its name, an odd, surprising story about a baseball game with seemingly little to no stakes, that continues on for long after it should’ve already ended.","Oct 2, 2024"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,Slant Magazine,75,Jake Cole,"Carson Lund treats the power of a shared interest with profound, elegiac empathy.","Jul 2, 2024"

EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,Chicago Tribune,75,Michael Phillips,"Places come; places go. Every human being deals with loss differently. “Eephus” acknowledges that, but it’s a sweet, sidewinding paradox of a sports movie: sentimental in a quietly unsentimental and offhandedly comic fashion.","Mar 20, 2025"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,The Hollywood Reporter,70,Jordan Mintzer,"Eephus isn’t exactly a baseball movie — it’s something closer to movie-baseball, where characters endlessly jostle back and forth under no real time constraints, watching the day slowly pass them by, simply out of love for the sport.","May 21, 2024"
EEPHUS,2024,Carson Lund,RogerEbert.com,63,Peyton Robinson,"The pacing works referentially to its namesake and real-time ambition, but the characters aren’t quite interesting or engaging enough to sustain attention for the whole runtime, and the film’s crawl eventually wears on weary knees.","Mar 7, 2025"
THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,New York Post,100,Johnny Oleksinski,"Directed by James Griffiths, this is the sort of hilarious heart-warmer that only comes around once or twice a year to offer a blessed break from darkness, snobbery and streaming schlock. It’s so easy to love, even if love doesn’t come easy for its characters.","Jan 30, 2025"
THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,Christian Science Monitor,100,Peter Rainer,"The Ballad of Wallis Island is both modest and magical. One of its co-stars, Carey Mulligan, has described its tone as a “gentle euphoria.” That phrase perfectly expresses how this wonderful movie – directed by James Griffiths from a script by Tom Basden and Tim Key – transports us.","Mar 26, 2025"
THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,The Associated Press,100,Lindsey Bahr,"The Ballad of Wallis Island is the kind movie that makes it all look so easy — filmmaking, performance, mood, chemistry.

THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,Los Angeles Times,100,Amy Nicholson,"I’d call “Wallis Island” a contender for the most quotable film of the year but there are so many good lines stacked on top of each other, and so much giggling on top of that, it’s impossible to keep up with Key’s wordplay.","Mar 28, 2025"
THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,Variety,90,Tomris Laffly,"Alive with plenty of droll British humor and with a music-filled, picturesque finale that is sincerely earned, The Ballad of Wallis Island is the best kind of crowd-pleaser: disarming, joyful and full of compassion for its oddball characters. This Sundance charmer doesn’t hit a false note.","Jan 28, 2025"
THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,Wall Street Journal,90,Kyle Smith,"Directed by James Griffiths, “Wallis Island” is warm, endearing and very funny, a quintessential indie smile-maker about nice, humble people adorably stumbling their way toward a little happiness.","Mar 27, 2025"

THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,Collider,80,Anna Miller,"Distancing itself from clichés in the name of honesty and earnestness, the charming British dramedy showcases the whole gamut of human relationships but takes tender care to highlight the good. The performances are delightfully honest, its cinematography is visually stunning and immersive, and the tale it tells is one of forgiveness and letting go – one that highlights the power of being gentle to one another.","Feb 6, 2025"
THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,The Film Stage,75,Kent M. Wilhelm,"The Ballad of Wallis Island doesn’t deliver any revelatory perspective on the idea of moving on, nor is it trying to. It’s a crowd-pleasing adult comedy that manages to be sentimental without being cloying, sweet without being saccharine.","Jan 27, 2025"
THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,IndieWire,75,Kate Erbland,"The result is a cozy crowdpleaser with real heart and some lovely songs, and one that doesn’t trade honesty for predictable beats.","Jan 27, 2025"

THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,Slant Magazine,75,Derek Smith,"The Ballad of Wallis Island plays both its drama and comedy in decidedly minor keys, straining neither for grand emotional revelations nor big laughs.","Mar 8, 2025"
THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,Observer,75,Oliver Jones,"A carefully considered mix of humor and melancholy glows in the fragile sunshine that bathes an isolated Welsh coastline in The Ballad of Wallis Island, a wan yet affecting consideration of lost love, forgotten bands and the odd ways those entities manifest themselves in our hearts and on our turntables.","Mar 28, 2025"

THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,Screen Rant,70,Graeme Guttmann,"The Ballad of Wallis Island is effortless in its execution and breezy in its pacing, which makes its emotional undertones all the more surprising and affecting.","Jan 27, 2025"
THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,The A.V. Club,67,Jacob Oller,"This fable’s push to meet, then fix, your heroes can still sound as saccharine as a solo acoustic set, but it’s smart enough to undercut itself early and often.","Mar 26, 2025"
THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,The New York Times,50,Jeannette Catsoulis,"Bereft of chuckles or even a substantial story, this maudlin musical fable never escapes the drag of a lead character with supporting-player energy.","Mar 27, 2025"
THE BALLAD OF WALLIS ISLAND,2025,James Griffiths,TheWrap,30,Chase Hutchinson,"It’s a cute premise that ultimately gets wrung so dry that you’re left waiting for it to finally stop. The majority of its jokes either land flat or are run into the ground. Even worse, it pulls on the heartstrings with such force and impatience that the audience manipulation is palpable in every painfully predictable scene.","Jan 27, 2025"

TWIN PEAKS: FIRE WALK WITH ME,1992,David Lynch,Boston Globe,25,Jay Carr,"Mostly, though, Lynch fills the screen with a lot of cynically off-putting and sadistic violence. In place of incident, character and a bemused view of small-town life, corrupt beneath its cherry-pie surface, we are essentially asked to witness torture - mostly of Laura Palmer, as her troubles lead her to self-destruct with drugs and promiscuity, including a couple of side trips to the Canadian bordello known as One-Eyed Jacks. For all the violence in Lynch's ""Blue Velvet,"" that film maintained a comic dimension. The violence in ""Wild at Heart,"" for all its extravagance of gesture, was hollow - stylized, not real...Here, there's no comedy, nothing surreal, just wave after wave of titillation. Except that it doesn't titillate. It depresses. There's no psychic charge on any of it. It proceeds from no artistic conviction, just from a cynical desire to squeeze a few more bucks from the already overworked corpse of Laura Palmer. It shows how quickly a creative impulse can be exhausted - from quirky originality toying with humanity's darker impulses to dispirited quasi-porn. [29 Aug 1992, p.23]",

PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE,2019,Céline Sciamma,New York Magazine (Vulture),100,Bilge Ebiri,"Portrait of a Lady on Fire builds and builds and builds, as we keep waiting for an explosion, a big emotional climax. And, not unlike with another great recent import, Pedro Almodóvar’s ""Pain and Glory,"" it arrives with the very last shot — which I won’t reveal other than to say it’s one of the finest pieces of acting and one of the most moving images I’ve seen in eons.","Feb 12, 2020"
PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE,2019,Céline Sciamma,Vox,100,Emily VanDerWerff,"What makes the French masterpiece Portrait of a Lady on Fire — one of my favorite movies ever made, and the perfect Valentine’s Day date movie — so good is that it’s both a great romance and a great love story.

PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE,2019,Céline Sciamma,The Seattle Times,100,Moira Macdonald,"“Do all lovers,” wonders Héloïse in a passionate moment, “feel as though they’re inventing something?” Portrait of a Lady on Fire, a bittersweet celebration of passion and art, feels like that; you’ve never seen another movie quite like this.

PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE,2019,Céline Sciamma,The Observer (UK),100,Mark Kermode,"Portrait of a Lady on Fire (the French title uses the less Jamesian “jeune fille”) seamlessly intertwines themes of love and politics, representation and reality. At times it plays like a breathless romance, trembling with passionate anticipation. Elsewhere, it seems closer to a sociopolitical treatise, what Sciamma has called “a manifesto about the female gaze”.","Mar 1, 2020"
PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE,2019,Céline Sciamma,The New Yorker,100,Richard Brody,"The movie dramatizes the constraints of the era, the imposition of a narrow and religion-based morality, the stern discipline that’s internalized as a result, the elision of women and their world from public life, and the firm expectations of family and society that Héloïse will endure in her unwanted marriage. Yet it does more than merely depict them—it embodies them, in the characters’ poised stillness, which makes the airy surroundings feel as rigid as stone.","Aug 4, 2020"
PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE,2019,Céline Sciamma,Vanity Fair,95,Richard Lawson,"In Sciamma’s gifted hands, the film escapes cliché and becomes something glorious—a study of forbidden love that grandly highlights how much has been lost under the crush of hetero patriarchy.","May 24, 2019"
PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE,2019,Céline Sciamma,Polygon,94,Karen Han,"The final shot of Céline Sciamma’s Portrait of a Lady on Fire is overwhelming.

PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE,2019,Céline Sciamma,Entertainment Weekly,91,Leah Greenblatt,"There’s almost no single moment in Portrait of a Lady on Fire that couldn’t be captured, mounted, and hung on a wall as high art.

PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE,2019,Céline Sciamma,Variety,90,Peter Debruge,"Though this gorgeous, slow-burn lesbian romance works strongly enough on a surface level, one can hardly ignore the fact, as true then as it is now, that the world looks different when seen through a woman’s eyes.","May 20, 2019"
PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE,2019,Céline Sciamma,The New Yorker,90,Anthony Lane,"For an instant, I heard the rumble of the coming Revolution, and wondered how Sciamma would conclude her engrossing movie. In violent devastation, perhaps? Well, yes, but the violence is that of a storm-tossed heart, and the final shot is of a woman — I won’t reveal who — shaken by ungovernable sobs, with smiles breaking through like shafts of sunlight. Reckon you can weather all that without falling apart? Good luck.","Dec 2, 2019"
PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE,2019,Céline Sciamma,Rolling Stone,90,Peter Travers,"Portrait of a Lady on Fire is enthralling on every level.

PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE,2019,Céline Sciamma,The New York Times,90,A.O. Scott,"This is less a chronicle of forbidden desire than an examination of how desire works. Like a lost work of 18th-century literature, it is at once ardent and rigorous, passionate and philosophical.","Dec 5, 2019"
PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE,2019,Céline Sciamma,The Verge,90,Joshua Rivera,"The conversations in Portrait of a Lady on Fire are among the most memorable people have had on a screen in some time, with each line a stanza in a poem, a reversal, a shift in perspective. With every exchange, the relationship between Marianne and Héloïse changes subtly.","Feb 17, 2020"
PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE,2019,Céline Sciamma,Austin Chronicle,89,Marjorie Baumgarten,"What the film excels at, however, is the anticipatory desire. It builds slowly, concluding with a stunning sequence that is all breathless remembrance and self-satisfaction that is both wordless and impalpable. The film will seem the height of romantic desire to some, but will be a slow burn for others.","Feb 19, 2020"

PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE,2019,Céline Sciamma,Slashfilm,85,Rafael Motamayor,"A Portrait of a Lady on Fire is a richly textured, highly evocative story of love, lust and longing, and thanks to exceptional direction and remarkable, talented actors it’s a work to be cherished.","Feb 12, 2020"
PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE,2019,Céline Sciamma,Original-Cin,83,Karen Gordon,"This isn’t a film that suddenly bursts out at you. Sciamma, like her characters, works by restraining everything. She doesn’t rush the story or focus on a building sense of hunger or passion. The title notwithstanding, the movie is a slow burn, not a fire.","Feb 12, 2020"
PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE,2019,Céline Sciamma,Screen Daily,80,Wendy Ide,Arthouse audiences will be intrigued to discover how Sciamma has channelled the fluid energy of her contemporary work into the more constrained environment of a costume drama.

REVENGE,2017,Coralie Fargeat,Austin Chronicle,89,Marc Savlov,Ferociously subversive and trippily beautiful debut feature from director and screenwriter Coralie Fargeat.,"May 9, 2018"
REVENGE,2017,Coralie Fargeat,RogerEbert.com,88,Christy Lemire,"The film we need right now, from a filmmaker we need right now: French writer/director Coralie Fargeat, who makes her stunning feature debut with a rape-revenge fantasy that’s as brutal as it is thrilling.","May 10, 2018"
REVENGE,2017,Coralie Fargeat,The Globe and Mail (Toronto),88,Barry Hertz,"From beginning to brutal end, this is Fargeat’s uncompromising creation, but Lutz is at the centre of the terror, and acquits herself well as a person never to be dismissed, or crossed, again.","May 10, 2018"
REVENGE,2017,Coralie Fargeat,Paste Magazine,87,Andrew Crump,"With Revenge, Fargeat has waved a blistering middle finger at rape culture and rape culture’s enablers. Revenge isn’t hers alone. It’s womanhood’s, too.","May 10, 2018"
REVENGE,2017,Coralie Fargeat,IndieWire,83,David Ehrlich,"Revenge is a bit too thin to sustain its running time (despite its slickness and mesmeric rhythm), but Fargeat’s well-executed finale is worth the wait, particularly for how it cements Lutz as a final girl for the ages. A girl who’s stripped of her humanity, and then finds the strength to return the favor several times over.","May 7, 2018"
REVENGE,2017,Coralie Fargeat,The Hollywood Reporter,80,David Rooney,"This is a rape retaliation thriller both tautly controlled and wildly over-the-top, executed with flashy style, sly visual humor and a subversive feminist sensibility.","Mar 27, 2018"
REVENGE,2017,Coralie Fargeat,Time Out,80,Cath Clarke,What’s interesting about Revenge is that it’s told from a female perspective – and by a female filmmaker.,"May 8, 2018"
REVENGE,2017,Coralie Fargeat,The New York Times,80,A.O. Scott,"Revenge leaves a lurid, punchy afterimage, an impression somewhere between righteous delight and quivering revulsion. It’s both a challenge and a calling card, in which Ms. Fargeat at once exposes what’s wrong with her chosen genre and demonstrates her mastery of it.","May 9, 2018"
REVENGE,2017,Coralie Fargeat,Empire,80,Helen O'Hara,"Even if you think you know where it’s going as its builds to a near-wordless finale (and you might be right), the moments of character detail are beautifully judged, and the gore surprisingly well splashed.","May 10, 2018"
REVENGE,2017,Coralie Fargeat,New York Magazine (Vulture),80,David Edelstein,"Revenge inverts the gutbucket revenge genre without transcending it. That said, why should men have all the fun? The movie is like Ladies’ Night at a sleaze-o bar.","May 11, 2018"
REVENGE,2017,Coralie Fargeat,Vanity Fair,80,K. Austin Collins,"Fargeat gets her thrills from all the bad things that make her genre great: Cinematography that’s rancid with heat and color, sound design that delights in every exaggerated crunch and squish.","May 11, 2018"
REVENGE,2017,Coralie Fargeat,The A.V. Club,75,Katie Rife,"The film works best if you approach it as a fantasy, with Jen as a near-supernatural angel of vengeance; otherwise, it’s easy to get hung up on the inconsistencies as the action grows increasingly over-the-top.","Mar 27, 2018"
REVENGE,2017,Coralie Fargeat,Slant Magazine,75,Chuck Bowen,"Fetishism, parody, and various registers of violence propel a livewire thriller that mines the free-floating hostility existing between genders.","May 7, 2018"
REVENGE,2017,Coralie Fargeat,The Atlantic,70,David Sims,"Swerving between thrill-a-minute action and intense, drawn-out suspense, Revenge has all the subtlety of a bazooka to the face, but it’s an arresting watch if you can stomach its most lurid moments of violence.","May 9, 2018"
REVENGE,2017,Coralie Fargeat,Arizona Republic,70,Bill Goodykoontz,"What’s as striking as the violence is Fargeat’s confidence as a filmmaker. She risks absurdity at every turn, fearlessly daring the audience to accept unlikely scenarios. Take that challenge. However difficult “Revenge” may be to watch at times, it’s worth it.","May 10, 2018"
REVENGE,2017,Coralie Fargeat,Consequence,67,Michael Roffman,Revenge is one big fuck you to a genre that has treated women like meat — often literally — and she takes back the reigns with incredible muscle. But what makes the movie riveting is how Lutz’s transition from damsel to destructor is filled with all kinds of tumbles.,"May 7, 2018"
REVENGE,2017,Coralie Fargeat,The Guardian,60,Peter Bradshaw,"A well made film, which slithers confidently in its slick of blood.","May 10, 2018"
REVENGE,2017,Coralie Fargeat,The Film Stage,58,Jared Mobarak,"Right when I was ready to resign myself to the thought that Revenge simply started too strong to maintain itself, Fargeat brought me back from the brink with a tense labyrinthine conclusion making use of its locale and blood as plot propulsion.","May 8, 2018"
NIGHT MOVES,1975,Arthur Penn,Chicago Sun-Times,100,Roger Ebert,Night Moves is one of the best psychological thrillers in a long time.,
NIGHT MOVES,1975,Arthur Penn,USA Today,100,Mike Clark,"Screenwriter Alan Sharp's dialogue, as edgy as his name, combines with Penn's incisive direction to create memorable characters played by Hackman, Ward, Jennifer Warren and a young James Woods as an auto mechanic you don't want messing with your points and plugs. [22 July 2005, p.6E]",
NIGHT MOVES,1975,Arthur Penn,Time Out,90,Staff (Not Credited),"A truly enigmatic thriller and a key film of the '70s, brilliantly scripted by Alan Sharp.",
NIGHT MOVES,1975,Arthur Penn,The A.V. Club,83,Nathan Rabin,"Filled with shadows both literal and figurative, Night Moves elegantly combines the hard-edged pessimism, crackling banter, and all-consuming darkness of classic noir with the paranoia and bitterness that characterizes so much '70s cinema.",
NIGHT MOVES,1975,Arthur Penn,Chicago Reader,80,Jonathan Rosenbaum,One of Penn's best features; his direction of actors is sensitive and purposeful throughout.,

NIGHT MOVES,1975,Arthur Penn,Variety,70,Staff (Not Credited),"Night Moves is a paradox: a suspenseless suspenser, very well cast with players who lend sustained interest to largely synthetic theatrical characters.",
NIGHT MOVES,1975,Arthur Penn,The New York Times,60,Vincent Canby,"An elegant conundrum, a private‐eye film that has its full share of duplicity, violence and bizarre revelation, but whose mind keeps straying from questions of pure narrative to those of the hero's psyche.",
THE FRENCH CONNECTION,1971,William Friedkin,TV Guide Magazine,100,Staff (Not credited),"This tough, brilliant crime film features Hackman as the indefatigable Popeye Doyle, who passionately hates drug pushers.",
THE FRENCH CONNECTION,1971,William Friedkin,Chicago Tribune,100,Gene Siskel,"There is only one problem with the excitement generated by this film. After it is over, you will walk out of the theater and, as I did, curse the tedium of your own life. I kept looking for someone who I could throw up against a wall.  [8 November 1971]",
THE FRENCH CONNECTION,1971,William Friedkin,Empire,100,Andrew Collins,Friedkin's hand-held documentary style was the perfect vehicle for the film's pumped-up verite.,
THE FRENCH CONNECTION,1971,William Friedkin,Slant Magazine,100,Budd Wilkins,"An electrifying achievement, drawing its high-voltage forward momentum from the collision of semi-documentary procedural, with its based-on-real-events verisimilitude, and downbeat rogue-cop revisionism.",
THE FRENCH CONNECTION,1971,William Friedkin,Chicago Sun-Times,100,Roger Ebert,"The French Connection is routinely included, along with ""Bullitt,"" ""Diva"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" on the short list of movies with the greatest chase scenes of all time. What is not always remembered is what a good movie it is apart from the chase scene.",
THE FRENCH CONNECTION,1971,William Friedkin,IGN,100,R.L. Shaffer,It is a damn good detective movie.,
THE FRENCH CONNECTION,1971,William Friedkin,Los Angeles Times,100,Staff (Not Credited),"Surely one of the most exciting -- and brutal -- movies ever made...This is slam-bang, suspenseful, sardonically funny, furious-paced melodrama culminating in the justly famous chase sequence. [21 July 1985, p.5]",
THE FRENCH CONNECTION,1971,William Friedkin,Philadelphia Inquirer,100,Desmond Ryan,"The chase influenced a generation of filmmakers, and Hackman's Popeye Doyle put an indelible stamp on the archetypal burned-out cop who was to become such a ubiquitous presence in movies. [12 March 1999, p.16]",
THE FRENCH CONNECTION,1971,William Friedkin,The A.V. Club,91,Keith Phipps,"I'd seen moments from that chase for years, held up as an example of what makes the film great. And it is a great sequence. But it's even better in context, arriving after many scenes of false starts, wrong turns, and frustrating dead ends, like a brilliantly staged cat-and-mouse game on the subway involving Doyle and Fernando Rey's smooth French gangster. The explosions have even more impact when you first get to see the fuses slowly burning down...It's also what most imitators don't get. You can put together the most exciting sequence ever filmed, and it won't matter—or at least won't matter beyond the seconds it takes to unfold—if the material around it isn't there.",
THE FRENCH CONNECTION,1971,William Friedkin,Entertainment Weekly,91,Mark Harris,"To watch it now is to appreciate more than ever Gene Hackman’s uncompromising talent, Owen Roizman’s great, barely-color cinematography, and a time when the spectacle of a foulmouthed, racist, brutal cop could still outrage as many moviegoers as it excited.",
THE FRENCH CONNECTION,1971,William Friedkin,The New York Times,90,Roger Greenspun,"The French Connection is a film of almost incredible suspense, and it includes, among a great many chilling delights, the most brilliantly executed chase sequence I have ever seen. [8 October 1971]",

THE FRENCH CONNECTION,1971,William Friedkin,The Guardian,90,Peter Bradshaw,"The final moments of The French Connection are a powerful, even magnificent repudiation of the modern piety of redemption and sympathy. It is a stunningly nihilist ending, one to set alongside Polanski's Chinatown.",
THE FRENCH CONNECTION,1971,William Friedkin,Time,90,Jay Cocks,"The French Connection is a knockout police thriller with so much jarring excitement that it almost calls for comic-book expletives. POW!, ZOWIE! The film has all the depth of a mud puddle, but Director William Friedkin (The Night They Raided Minsky's) sets such a frantic pace that there is hardly a chance to notice, much less care.",
THE FRENCH CONNECTION,1971,William Friedkin,Chicago Reader,90,Dave Kehr,"This 1971 thriller about a heroin bust is solid, slick filmmaking, full of dirty cops, shrewd operators, and slam-bang action. Friedkin's close study of Raoul Walsh pays off in the justly celebrated chase sequence.",
THE FRENCH CONNECTION,1971,William Friedkin,New York Daily News,88,Kathleen Carroll,"The French Connection is pure dynamite. Its trigger-fast, explosive scenes and high-tension chase sequences (the one in “Bullitt” pales by comparison) will have you literally gasping for breath.",
THE FRENCH CONNECTION,1971,William Friedkin,The New Yorker,80,Pauline Kael,"A hugely successful slam-bang thriller that zaps the audience with noise, speed, and brutality. It's certainly exciting, bu that excitement isn't necessarily a pleasure. The ominous music keeps tightening the screws and heating things up; the movie is like an aggravated case of New York.",
THE FRENCH CONNECTION,1971,William Friedkin,Time Out,50,Staff (Not Credited),"The real problems, however, are that Friedkin's nervy, noisy, undisciplined pseudo-realism sits uneasily with his suspense-motivated shock editing; and that compared to (say) Siegel's Dirty Harry, the film maintains no critical distance from (indeed, rather relishes) its 'loveable' hero's brutal vigilante psychology.",
