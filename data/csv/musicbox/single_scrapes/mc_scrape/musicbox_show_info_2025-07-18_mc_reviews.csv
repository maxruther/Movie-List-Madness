EDDINGTON,2025,Ari Aster,The Playlist,100,Elena Lazic,"More conventional than any of Aster’s previous work, Eddington is also more rigorous and explicit in its political engagement — the work of a maturing filmmaker eager to make it clear that his dark and scathing sense of humor is anything but an empty provocation.","May 19, 2025"
EDDINGTON,2025,Ari Aster,IndieWire,91,David Ehrlich,"Aster, who’s exclusively interested in making the kind of films that should be reviewed straight onto a prescription pad, is too beholden to his neuroses for his latest movie to play like a cheap provocation. This time, however, there’s a good chance those are your neuroses, too.","May 16, 2025"
EDDINGTON,2025,Ari Aster,Paste Magazine,89,Jason Gorber,"Excoriating and exhilarating in equal measure, it is the first truly great movie to deal explicitly with the unique madness and malice that the global pandemic revealed, a kind of touchstone for a time and place that with only a few years remove feels at once as fictional and otherworldly as a sci-fi novel, and at the same time the very real-world harbinger of the political shifts that proceeded.","May 19, 2025"
EDDINGTON,2025,Ari Aster,The Globe and Mail (Toronto),89,Barry Hertz,"The result is a magnificently off-the-rails poison pill of a film, one that skitters from paranoiac thriller to reactionary satire to something far more caustic and unnerving. It is the cinematic equivalent of long COVID – lingering, haunting, and demanding rigorous, skeptical investigation.","Jul 15, 2025"
EDDINGTON,2025,Ari Aster,The Daily Beast,83,Esther Zuckerman,"Eddington isn’t a movie that moralizes, but at the same time it doesn’t take the stance that both sides make some good points. Rather it’s a period piece about recent history that articulates why everything feels so doomed right now while still finding the space to be utterly ridiculous.","May 17, 2025"
EDDINGTON,2025,Ari Aster,Collider,80,Emma Kiely,"With Joaquin Phoenix at the height of his abilities, Eddington is, if you look close enough, just as, if not more terrifying than anything Paimon or a Swedish cult could ever unleash.","May 16, 2025"
EDDINGTON,2025,Ari Aster,BBC,80,Nicholas Barber,"Its low-level strangeness jumps to surreal and gory heights – and it keeps going higher until it hits a peak of gonzo high-adrenaline fun that leaves you reeling and breathless. Many viewers will have had enough of the film long before then, but there is something heroic about Aster's uncompromising determination to go his own way.","May 16, 2025"
EDDINGTON,2025,Ari Aster,The Independent,80,Sophie Monks Kaufman,"This is Aster’s funniest film to date, and makes use of an ever expanding and shifting cast to dot the 150-minute runtime with well-observed comic details and visual payoffs.","May 16, 2025"
EDDINGTON,2025,Ari Aster,Variety,80,Owen Gleiberman,"[Aster] wants to show us the really big picture, and while “Eddington” isn’t a horror movie, it puts its finger on a kind of madness you’ll recognize with a tremor.","May 16, 2025"
EDDINGTON,2025,Ari Aster,Slashfilm,80,Bill Bria,"It's a film that never feels neutered or held back, and as such it lingers in the mind for days afterward.","Jul 3, 2025"
EDDINGTON,2025,Ari Aster,TheWrap,75,Ben Croll,"Aster has always had a knack for confrontation, while Phoenix works best as an open-nerve. That the duo should prove so adept tapping into a vein of neurotic action is one of the many brutal surprises in a social satire as blunt and broad as America itself.","May 16, 2025"
EDDINGTON,2025,Ari Aster,Slant Magazine,75,Rocco T. Thompson,Eddington is especially pointed in the way that it views our online connectedness as a social cancer rather than an engine for progress.,"Jul 10, 2025"
EDDINGTON,2025,Ari Aster,San Francisco Chronicle,75,G. Allen Johnson,Phoenix is the perfect instrument for Aster’s bleak and self-destructive view of humanity. Consider “Eddington” a warning.,"Jul 15, 2025"
EDDINGTON,2025,Ari Aster,Chicago Tribune,75,Michael Phillips,"When Aster lays off the easy comic despair in favor of more ambiguous and dimensional feelings, interactions and moments, “Eddington” becomes the movie he wanted. His script has a million problems with clarity, coincidence and the nagging drag of a protagonist set up for a long, grisly comeuppance, yet “Eddington” is probably Aster’s strongest film visually.","Jul 16, 2025"
EDDINGTON,2025,Ari Aster,Rolling Stone,70,David Fear,"The overall lack of subtlety suits the age Aster is taking to task, though it also makes everything feel slightly wobbly on its feet. The viewpoint is both-sides misanthropy. Jonathan Swift has some notes.","May 17, 2025"
EDDINGTON,2025,Ari Aster,The A.V. Club,67,Farah Cheded,"Eddington is only a partly coherent mishmash of tones and ideas: sincere and satirical, astute and self-obfuscating. The only thing it is completely is ambitious.","May 20, 2025"
EDDINGTON,2025,Ari Aster,RogerEbert.com,63,Brian Tallerico,"It’s not just about the divisiveness of 2020; it’s designed to be divisive itself in 2025. To that end, even if you hate it, it’s kind of done its job.","May 18, 2025"
EDDINGTON,2025,Ari Aster,Vanity Fair,60,Richard Lawson,"Eddington gradually shifts away from the hyper topical and into a despairing, bleakly amusing look at an America prone to violent fantasy and deed, entrenched in escalating conflict, caught in a terrible entropy. When Aster finally knuckles down and ramps up the action, Eddington takes strange flight.","May 16, 2025"
EDDINGTON,2025,Ari Aster,New York Magazine (Vulture),60,Alison Willmore,"No genre really makes more sense for this moment than horror — except, maybe, for black comedy, and Aster’s bracingly nasty but centerless new film offers plenty of both.","May 17, 2025"
EDDINGTON,2025,Ari Aster,Time,60,Stephanie Zacharek,"If this wigged-out modern Western doesn’t quite work, it’s at the very least a cry of vexation over what our country, messy at the best of times, has become, thanks to a virus that found its way not just into our lungs, but into our very lifeblood. Dr. Aster has listened in on America’s heartbeat; the diagnosis is that we’re basically a mess.","May 17, 2025"
EDDINGTON,2025,Ari Aster,Screen Rant,60,Graeme Guttmann,"At times, it can be bitterly hysterical, with Aster, who also wrote the film, further flexing his comedic muscles after his previous film with Phoenix. On the other hand, Eddington can be almost too on-the-nose, knicking the surface of complex issues but pulling the blade away before it can really draw blood.","May 18, 2025"
EDDINGTON,2025,Ari Aster,The Film Stage,58,Rory O'Connor,"The character’s thinly sketched beliefs combined with Phoenix’s uncharacteristically vague performance keep him constantly at arm’s reach. We never really get into his head, which makes his eventual downfall (or Falling Down) feel both nihilistic and dramatically undercharged.","May 18, 2025"
EDDINGTON,2025,Ari Aster,Screen Daily,50,Tim Grierson,"In certain moments, the film’s absurdism recalls that era’s paranoia and volcanic anger, but too often Aster overshoots the mark, collecting the period’s signature elements without finding much that is smart to say about them.","May 16, 2025"
EDDINGTON,2025,Ari Aster,The Associated Press,50,Lindsey Bahr,"Five years after we just went through (at least a lot of) this, “Eddington” somehow seems both too late and too soon, especially when it offers so little wisdom or insight beyond a vision of hopelessness.","Jul 14, 2025"
EDDINGTON,2025,Ari Aster,The Guardian,40,Peter Bradshaw,There is no accumulation of drama or tension or intellectual revelation and the setpiece shootout is ultimately valueless. What exactly is it saying that we didn’t know already? The wait for Aster to recover his directorial form goes on.,"May 16, 2025"
EDDINGTON,2025,Ari Aster,The Times,40,Kevin Maher,"It’s an ambitious contemporary western shot last year yet set in the summer of 2020, and ostensibly aims, in almost every scene, to analyse and ridicule the political obsessions and digital neuroses that dominated that moment. And, well, it’s quite the mess.","May 16, 2025"
EDDINGTON,2025,Ari Aster,The Hollywood Reporter,40,David Rooney,"It’s bloated, self-indulgent, rambling, crazily ambitious and commendably odd, but so overstuffed it becomes a lethal combination of baffling and boring.","May 16, 2025"
EDDINGTON,2025,Ari Aster,IGN,40,Siddhant Adlakha,"With Eddington, Ari Aster tries his hand at political satire and turns in his first bad movie.","May 20, 2025"
KILL THE JOCKEY,2024,Luis Ortega,RogerEbert.com,88,Carlos Aguilar,"If the director’s spell has taken hold as presumably intended, by the time the most outlandish touches appear, one has already surrendered to its visceral, chaotic allure.","Jul 2, 2025"
KILL THE JOCKEY,2024,Luis Ortega,Screen Daily,80,Wendy Ide,"Like its magnetic central character, the entertaining latest from Luis Ortega is fascinating: a playful, shape-shifting, questioning journey that refuses to be neatly pinned down.","Aug 29, 2024"
KILL THE JOCKEY,2024,Luis Ortega,Slant Magazine,75,William Repass,"Kill the Jockey’s originality consists not just in taking the clichéd metaphor of rebirth literally, but in casually ratcheting that literalness to ever more fantastical degrees.","Jun 29, 2025"
KILL THE JOCKEY,2024,Luis Ortega,Variety,70,Guy Lodge,"Awash with kooky gags and bolstered by the strange, soulful presence of leading man Nahuel Pérez Biscayart, it’s fun but flighty, liable to throw some viewers from the saddle.","Aug 29, 2024"
KILL THE JOCKEY,2024,Luis Ortega,Screen Rant,70,Alexander Harrison,"The cast deserves real credit for that, Biscayart especially. His physical expressiveness is truly extraordinary, and without his performance to transition us to the final act, Kill the Jockey doesn't succeed.","Aug 30, 2024"
KILL THE JOCKEY,2024,Luis Ortega,The Film Verdict,70,Stephen Dalton,"This ebullient equestrian comedy thriller is effortlessly enjoyable as camp spectacle, with shades of Almodovar in the mix, even if its twist-heady screwball plot ultimately delivers more style than substance.","Sep 5, 2024"
KILL THE JOCKEY,2024,Luis Ortega,IndieWire,67,Sophie Monks Kaufman,"Kill the Jockey is an elusive and sometimes frustrating watch. It elides interpretation in ways both intentional and undercooked, flirts with a greatness that isn’t fully earned, yet it has some glorious moments and never unseats the viewer.","Aug 29, 2024"
KILL THE JOCKEY,2024,Luis Ortega,The Guardian,60,Xan Brooks,"It’s too skimpy and self-conscious, more a series of gestures than an organic whole. But Ortega frames his action with a delicious high style, interspersing tense standoffs with formal dance sequences. He gives the impression that all his characters are locked in a bizarre hothouse romance, even when they are chasing or attempting to kill one another.","Aug 29, 2024"
KILL THE JOCKEY,2024,Luis Ortega,The Hollywood Reporter,60,Leslie Felperin,"In the end, it all feels a bit like a fashion film or some other branded exercise in style — except that the brand is Ortega’s peculiar and unique vision.","Aug 29, 2024"
KILL THE JOCKEY,2024,Luis Ortega,Collider,60,Elisa Guimarães,"It works for about half an hour, but its excess of panache eventually gets tiring, and the story's seams are just too frail to hold it together. Still, those dance sequences are really something.","Jul 7, 2025"
KILL THE JOCKEY,2024,Luis Ortega,The New York Times,50,Natalia Winkelman,"The director, Luis Ortega, doesn’t give much reason to care about Remo’s conflict — the protagonist’s catatonia inspires the same in the viewer — and instead exhausts his efforts on a mannered blankness of style and mood.","Jul 2, 2025"
KILL THE JOCKEY,2024,Luis Ortega,Austin Chronicle,50,Richard Whittaker,"It’s rare to say about a contemporary film, but maybe it could gain from a little didacticism, a little lecturing, a little clarity to ensure that its muddied purpose becomes clearer. Instead, its idiosyncrasies obscure its insights.","Jul 10, 2025"

The neat script also fills in a little more of the Freddie mythology, including a suitably tasteless account of his conception.

DUNKIRK,2017,Christopher Nolan,The Guardian,100,Peter Bradshaw,"This is a powerful, superbly crafted film with a story to tell, avoiding war porn in favour of something desolate and apocalyptic, a beachscape of shame, littered with soldiers zombified with defeat, a grimly male world with hardly any women on screen.

These are not the first words you expect to see applied to a giant-budgeted summer entertainment made by one of the industry's most dependably commercial big-name directors. But this is a war film like few others, one that may employ a large and expensive canvas but that conveys the whole through isolated, brilliantly realized, often private moments more than via sheer spectacle, although that is here too.","Jul 17, 2017"
DUNKIRK,2017,Christopher Nolan,Tampa Bay Times,100,Steve Persall,"Dunkirk is a staggering feat of filmmaking, as Nolan's fans are accustomed. Van Hoytema's cinematography conveys death trap closeness even with IMAX cameras on a vast beach.

DUNKIRK,2017,Christopher Nolan,ReelViews,88,James Berardinelli,"Although Dunkirk is technically a war film, its tone and style are those of a high-octane thriller.

DUNKIRK,2017,Christopher Nolan,Boston Globe,88,Ty Burr,"Taken as a whole, Dunkirk invites comparisons to the works of Kubrick and Spielberg, but it’s neither as scalding as “Full Metal Jacket” nor as clear-eyed, as aware of war’s terrible randomness, as “Saving Private Ryan.” Instead, a streak of honest sentiment, earned under the most hellish of circumstances, courses through this movie and provides it with spine and a soul.","Jul 19, 2017"

DUNKIRK,2017,Christopher Nolan,ScreenCrush,70,Matt Singer,"Dunkirk would have been even better, though, if any of the characters seemed as fully realized as the aerial and naval warfare. Without that, it works best as pure sensory experience; incredible visuals, intense battles.

DUNKIRK,2017,Christopher Nolan,New York Magazine (Vulture),70,David Edelstein,"What Nolan plus IMAX can do is go big. Spitfire swerving, boat tippings, men dropping to the sand as planes scream by — it doesn’t get any better.

TOP GUN: MAVERICK,2022,Joseph Kosinski,Collider,100,Ross Bonaime,"When talking about Top Gun: Maverick, it’s hard not to sound hyperbolic, but this is the rare case where it absolutely deserves all the massive praise. Top Gun: Maverick improves upon the original in every conceivable way (well, the soundtrack doesn’t have Berlin, so that’s one strike against it), and does so in a way that might make this one of the greatest sequels ever made. It’s also hard not to say this might have some of the most exciting action scenes to ever hit the skies, and gives Cruise one of his best performances by returning to the role that made him a star. Top Gun: Maverick is a marvel of a film, one that will truly take your breath away.","May 12, 2022"

TOP GUN: MAVERICK,2022,Joseph Kosinski,IndieWire,91,David Ehrlich,"Stainless where the original was musty, neutered where the original was soft-core (there isn’t a single gratuitous shower scene in this sequel, let alone three of them), and structured like an immaculate pop song where the original moved like freeform jazz, “Maverick” sounds like a major regression from an age where summer movies didn’t always play safe.

ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD,2019,Quentin Tarantino,Christian Science Monitor,75,Peter Rainer,"The paradox of Tarantino’s oeuvre is that it is highly derivative of other movies, mostly genre pulp, and yet the films seem distinctly his. He is the most influential director of his generation because he ranges promiscuously through pop culture and brings to his borrowings an incendiary force.","Jul 27, 2019"
ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD,2019,Quentin Tarantino,The Hollywood Reporter,70,David Rooney,"Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood is uneven, unwieldy in its structure and not without its flat patches. But it's also a disarming and characteristically subversive love letter to its inspiration.","May 21, 2019"
THE ROOM,2003,Tommy Wiseau,Chicago Reader,30,J.R. Jones,"This inept 2003 melodrama has become a Rocky Horror-style cult favorite...As someone who's watched more bad movies than you can imagine, I'm mostly immune to the so-bad-it's-good aesthetic, though I can see how, viewed in a theater at midnight after a few drinks, this might conjure up its own hilariously demented reality.",
THE ROOM,2003,Tommy Wiseau,Portland Oregonian,25,Marc Mohan,"Tommy Wiseau's film oozes sincerity, which is then slathered in a thick coating of oblivious narcissism, and sadly serves as an example that not everyone should follow their bliss...It's the emotional earnestness that places The Room squarely within Susan Sontag's famous definition of pure camp.",
THE ROOM,2003,Tommy Wiseau,Chicago Sun-Times,12,Bill Stamets,"You can laugh at lines like: ""Hey, everybody, let's go inside and eat some cake""; ""Leave your stupid comments in your pocket!""; ""Man, I just can't figure women out. Sometimes they're just too smart. Sometimes they're flat out stupid. Other times they're just evil."" In Wiseau's worldview, if ""The Room"" were a woman, she wouldn't be ""evil"" or ""too smart."" That leaves ""flat-out stupid."" [12 Feb 2012, p.B2]",
THE ROOM,2003,Tommy Wiseau,Variety,10,Scott Foundas,"The Room marks the writing-directing-acting debut of Tommy Wiseau, who's not just one of the most unusual looking and sounding (with an unidentifiable Eastern European accent) leading men ever to grace the screen, but a narcissist nonpareil whose movie makes Vincent Gallo's ""The Brown Bunny"" seem the apotheosis of cinematic self-restraint.",
THE ROOM,2003,Tommy Wiseau,Movie Nation,0,Roger Moore,"That’s the trick to making a cult film. It can’t just be bad, it has to be memorably so, and The Room is.",
JACKASS: THE MOVIE,2002,Jeff Tremaine,L.A. Weekly,80,Paul Malcolm,"The Jackass boys achieve true genius, however, when they take their penance public. Before stunned, inert onlookers, these skate-punk Situationists transform official zones of work and leisure -- office parks, golf courses, bowling alleys -- into arenas of dangerous stupidity to remind us that, in the end, we&#8217;re all just meat.",
JACKASS: THE MOVIE,2002,Jeff Tremaine,Film Threat,80,Pete Vonder Haar,One of the funniest films I&#8217;ve seen all year.,
JACKASS: THE MOVIE,2002,Jeff Tremaine,Entertainment Weekly,75,Owen Gleiberman,"Provokes a suspense halfway between comedy and horror. I'm not sure if I enjoyed myself, exactly, but I could hardly wait to see what I'd be appalled by next.",
JACKASS: THE MOVIE,2002,Jeff Tremaine,Village Voice,70,Ed Halter,"Shrewdly, the Jackass gang didn't mess with their established formula in the transition to the big screen.",
JACKASS: THE MOVIE,2002,Jeff Tremaine,Austin Chronicle,67,Kimberley Jones,"All told, either you get it or you don't. Film critics and senators with election prospects don't. Kids in the mood to laugh at stupid shit for 87 minutes do. I'll toss my hat in the latter ring with glee.",
JACKASS: THE MOVIE,2002,Jeff Tremaine,Miami Herald,63,Rene Rodriguez,"As much as I laughed throughout the movie, I cannot mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment, or even performance art, although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys' superhuman capacity to withstand pain. Compared to these jackasses, Vin Diesel is a big, overpaid wuss.",
JACKASS: THE MOVIE,2002,Jeff Tremaine,Los Angeles Times,50,Manohla Dargis,"At their best, they're closer to the Three Stooges; at their most banal, they're as original as the Red Hot Chili Peppers performing nude with socks on their penises -- It's a hoot.",
JACKASS: THE MOVIE,2002,Jeff Tremaine,Chicago Reader,50,J.R. Jones,Unfortunately I can't give this a thumbs-up or thumbs-down; I haven't yet developed an aesthetic that will accommodate a guy firing a bottle rocket from his ass.,
JACKASS: THE MOVIE,2002,Jeff Tremaine,The New York Times,40,Dana Stevens,"Like a documentary version of ""Fight Club,"" shorn of social insight, intellectual pretension and cinematic interest.  It also offers a supremely literal-minded version of slapstick.",
JACKASS: THE MOVIE,2002,Jeff Tremaine,Variety,30,Joe Leydon,"It's plotless, shapeless -- and yet, it must be admitted, not entirely humorless. Indeed, the more outrageous bits achieve a shock-you-into-laughter intensity of almost Dadaist proportions.",
JACKASS: THE MOVIE,2002,Jeff Tremaine,The Globe and Mail (Toronto),25,Jennie Punter,"Essentially a slapstick movie with no plot or -- as my boyfriend called it after recovering from 1&#189; hours of side-splitting laughter -- ""the ultimate big-screen TV experience.""",
JACKASS: THE MOVIE,2002,Jeff Tremaine,The A.V. Club,20,Tasha Robinson,"Audience members are likely to feel like they're right there in the picture, suffering for no reason and trying to pretend it's funny.",
JACKASS: THE MOVIE,2002,Jeff Tremaine,New York Post,0,Lou Lumenick,"To call Jackass: The Movie the worst movie of the year is practically a compliment. This plotless, crudely videotaped collection of moronic stunts is a movie in the same sense that those hideous, velvet depictions of Elvis are paintings.",
JACKASS: THE MOVIE,2002,Jeff Tremaine,New York Daily News,0,Jack Mathews,"This is the biggest lowdown, rotten, disgusting, depraved sideshow in the megaplex. Check your brains, your taste and your self-respect right over there with the bearded ticket taker.",
