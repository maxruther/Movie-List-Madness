The latest film from acclaimed director Alex Ross Perry is a documentary that may or may not be entirely true, may or may not be totally sincere, and may or may not be more about the idea of the band—or any band—than a history of the short-lived, passionately loved, commercially marginal, ’90s American alternative group Pavement.This unconventional film about a highly unconventional band incorporates a stage musical, rock biopic, gallery exhibition, archival footage, and contemporary observational footage to create a film as irreducible, uncharacterizable, and entertaining as the band and its music. Anchored by Pavement’s slacker-sage-sphinx, Stephen Malkmus, the film features performances by Joe Keery, Jason Schwartzman, Tim Heidecker, and Zoe Lister-Jones.",https://musicboxtheatre.com/films-and-events/pavements,Music Box,2025-06-25T21:23:52.470408+00:00

A STORY OF FLOATING WEEDS,1934,86,35mm,Yasujirô Ozu,"Tadao Ikeda, Yasujirô Ozu","Takeshi Sakamoto, Chôko Iida, Kôji Mitsui","Early in his career, Japanese filmmaker Yasujirō Ozu regularly channelled the snappy verve of American commercial cinema, name-checking Ernst Lubitsch and Harold Lloyd and fashioning transpacific translations of gangster films and melodramas. (In the fanciful world of silent Ozu, everyone is a cinephile with a Hollywood sweet tooth, with posters for Our Dancing Daughters and The Champ hanging in office buildings and apartments.) Even A Story of Floating Weeds, an understated and seemingly culturally-specific account of a kabuki ensemble touring the Japanese countryside, was inspired by the 1928 carnival drama The Barker from American studio First National. In Ozu’s version, Kihachi (Takeshi Sakamoto) leads a band of actors eking out sustenance and little more, cheerfully trouping through provincial theaters with leaky roofs. When they arrive by train at a quiet town in the mountains, Kihachi seeks out Otsune (Chôko Iida), the mother of the son he fathered on a tour many years ago. The son, Shinkichi (Kôji Mitsui), believes that Kihachi is his long-absent but fun-loving uncle, good for a fishing lesson and nothing more. When Kihachi’s lover Otaka (Emiko Yagumo), a fellow actor, learns of his clandestine meetings with Otsune, she orchestrates a plot to smoke out his secret passions. This simple, beautifully spare narrative demonstrated Ozu’s evolving craftsmanship and pointed the way towards a more idiosyncratic style that left familiar genre tropes, Hollywood or otherwise, far behind. The sturdy perfection of Ozu’s new style was confirmed a quarter century later when he remade the film as Floating Weeds, which, despite the addition of sound, color, and a seaside locale, repeated many of the same shots, gestures, and jokes with undiminished impact.",https://musicboxtheatre.com/films-and-events/a-story-of-floating-weeds,Music Box,2025-06-25T21:23:52.470408+00:00

A look at the darkness beneath the seductive lifestyles of Rome’s rich and glamorous, the film follows a notorious celebrity journalist (a sublimely cool Marcello Mastroianni) during a hectic week spent on the peripheries of the spotlight. This mordant picture was an incisive commentary on the deepening decadence of contemporary Europe, and it provided a prescient glimpse of just how gossip- and fame-obsessed our society would become.

A surrealist tour-de-force filmed on soundstages and locations alike, and overflowing with the same sensory (and sensual) invention heretofore found only in the classic movie-musicals (and Fellini's own oeuvre), La città delle donne [City of Women] taps into the era's restless youth culture, coalescing into nothing less than Fellini's post-punk opus.Marcello Mastroianni appears as Fellini's alter ego in a semi-reprise of his character from 8 1/2, Snàporaz. As though passing into a dream, the charismatic avatar finds himself initiated into a phantasmagoric world where women--or an idea of women--have taken power, and which is structured like an array of psychosexual set-pieces, culminating in a bravura hot-air balloon that decisively sticks the ""anti"" up into ""climax.""",https://musicboxtheatre.com/films-and-events/city-of-women,Music Box,2025-06-25T21:23:52.470408+00:00
THE HOURS: A SQUARE FILM,1995,85,DCP,Antoinetta Angelidi,Antoinetta Angelidi,"Katia Gerou, Evri Sophroniadou, Thodoris Polizonis","Memory as construction and as internal pulse. Spendo, on the edge of suicide, relives her life, reconstructs it and, finally, liberates herself. Sadness flows and fills the space. The hours coexist and intertwine. The world: a flesh-eating mechanism. A descend begins, a rhythmic immersion into the depths of memory, where evil appears in the form of good. Until memory no longer repeats itself; a new viewpoint sneaks in. The hours are noiselessly formed anew. Violent dependence is left in the past.Antoinetta Angelidi (b. 1950) is a pioneering Greek filmmaker and visual artist whose works regularly distance viewers from reality “in order to reach out to the Real.” Her feminist, surreal movies pull from both her dreams and art history, regularly inverting codes and employing multiple narratives. Her 1995 masterwork The Hours: A Square Film (1995) is a deeply autobiographical film that alludes to a traumatic experience she had as a child. Angelidi considers it “the final product of a long, unsuccessful psychoanalysis… When it was finished, I felt redeemed.”",https://musicboxtheatre.com/films-and-events/the-hours-a-square-film,Music Box,2025-06-25T21:23:52.470408+00:00

Made on a thrifty budget of $16.5 million, what initially seemed destined to be a minor cult hit quickly became a worldwide phenomenon. And with good reason: It’s hysterical. Mike Myers gives two instantly iconic performances: Austin Powers, the grooviest spy of the swinging 60s who is forced to reckon with the politics and cynicism of the 90s, and Dr. Evil, his folically-challenged, power-hungry, cat-fancying nemesis.  Taking influence from not only James Bond, but Harry Palmer, The Beatles, Blake Edwards, and BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS (Which may have contributed to it receiving “Two Thumbs Up” by Siskel & Ebert!), AUSTIN POWERS is an effective time capsule of two bygone eras, the late 60s and the late 90s.

PIERROT LE FOU,1965,110,35mm,Jean-Luc Godard,"Rémo Forlani, Jean-Luc Godard, Lionel White","Jean-Paul Belmondo, Anna Karina, Graziella Galvani","Given the half-century or so of his career spent bouncing between televisual experiments, incendiary collectivist agitprop, and narrative ruminations on the fractured state of culture, it can be easy to overlook that for a few years in the 1960s Jean-Luc Godard was considered a bankable box office prospect. The director’s 1964 announcement of his forthcoming adaptation of Lionel White’s crime novel Obsession gave little sense for how far afield he was about to stray from the era’s commercial cinema. By the time the cameras were scheduled to roll on Pierrot le fou, Godard still had no concrete plans for the production beyond a handful of scheduled location shoots and a cast which included Jean-Paul Belmondo and Godard’s ex-wife Anna Karina as the leads. Ostensibly guided by the source novel’s plot, in which a middle-class father abandons his family to pursue a relationship with their criminally-connected babysitter, Godard and his collaborators made the film up as they shot it, taking inspiration from the era’s political upheavals, Godard’s own personal and professional crises, and, inevitably, the films and art the director loved. The result is as unconventional as its technique, careening through a series of episodes between the unfortunate lovers Marianne (Karina) and Ferdinand (Belmondo) in which they petulantly argue about romance and philosophy, perform lo-fi musical production numbers, accumulate a menagerie of exotic pets, pantomime the colonial occupation of Vietnam, and, in a climax which inspired a 15-year-old Chantal Akerman to (cinematically) blow up her town, explode.Preceded by: “Duck Amuck” (Chuck Jones, 1953) – 7 min – 35mm",https://musicboxtheatre.com/films-and-events/pierrot-le-fou,Music Box,2025-06-25T21:23:52.470408+00:00

Tristan Blue, 2024, 9 min)Secluded in the coastal forests of Northern California, an elder queer hermit searches for strange frequencies hidden in nature.

She finds solace in an old picture book; a tale of sirens who rise from the crashing waves to fight back against their captors.

Her wife of 3-months, AUGUST, comforts and reassures her…and it almost works until JUSTIN, her best friend and hook-up-turned-father of her child, bursts into the house, armed with his binder of research. Determined to save these two wholly unprepared mothers-to-be, he invites himself to stay over—much to August’s dismay. FINDING DADDY (Dir. Emily Wilson, 2025, 12 min)Sisters Dinky and Flossy are filthy, broke, and barely holding it together. But when Dinky discovers their estranged Dad flaunting wealth on some sugar baby site, she decides to confront him, dragging a skeptical Flossy back to their childhood home to uncover the truth...and maybe some cash. As the sisters confront their deadbeat Dad, old grudges and unsavory emotions resurface, but their simmering resentment might be the spark they need to turn things around.",https://musicboxtheatre.com/films-and-events/shorts-program-3-what-breaks-through,Music Box,2025-06-25T21:23:52.470408+00:00

BUDDIES,1985,81,DCP,Arthur J. Bressan Jr.,Arthur J. Bressan Jr.,"Geoff Edholm, David Schachter, Billy Lux","Arthur J. Bressan Jr. (Gay USA) created this indie masterpiece in 1985, which was the first feature-length drama about AIDS. When 25 year-old gay yuppie David (David Schachter) volunteers to be a ""buddy"" to an AIDS patient, the gay community center assigns him to Robert (Geoff Edholm), a 32 year-old politically impassioned gay California gardener abandoned by his friends and lovers. Revolving around the confines of Robert's Manhattan hospital room, Bressan skillfully unfolds this devastating two-hander (the rest of the cast is only heard offscreen). As David gazes out at the piers and rooftops of Manhattan, we hear his deftly scripted diary entries in voiceover. And as David is changed by knowing Robert, so, too, are we. In the simplicity of the story and the elegance of its unfolding, Buddies achieves a rare perfection.
