On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,2024,RogerEbert.com,100,Monica Castillo,"On Becoming a Guinea Fowl is an uncomfortable but entrancing watch, a tribute to shattering silence around family secrets and bucking tradition for the sake of empathy.","Mar 7, 2025"
On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,2024,The A.V. Club,100,Katie Rife,"Nyoni’s direction is brilliant, contrasting the chaos of Uncle Fred’s multi-day funeral with the stillness and solace Shula finds in her cousins’ company.","Mar 8, 2025"
On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,2024,The New Yorker,100,Justin Chang,"It is taut, absorbing, and, at ninety-nine minutes, ruthlessly concise. But what it bears witness to, over several days and nights of funeral rites, is a staggering endurance test, in which Shula is tasked with honoring the dishonorable.","Mar 10, 2025"
On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,2024,Boston Globe,100,Odie Henderson,"This is one of the year’s best films, a heartbreaking stunner that’s not easily shaken.","Mar 13, 2025"
On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,2024,The Film Stage,91,Michael Frank,"The writer-director never rushes this story, but still wastes no time in the film––each scene contains weight and value. Each moment builds on the memories of Shula and of the women in this family, fractured together, constantly reminded of monstrosities, somehow still taking steps forward.","Oct 23, 2024"
On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,2024,Paste Magazine,91,Andrew Crump,"On Becoming a Guinea Fowl details the ways tradition is exploited and warped, and to whom’s favor, gently at times, and with a steely edge at others.","Mar 18, 2025"
On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,2024,The Hollywood Reporter,90,Lovia Gyarkye,"Perhaps what’s most impressive about On Becoming a Guinea Fowl is Nyoni’s respect for subtext. Her film doesn’t aim to be a guide, a balm or an ode to forgiveness. The director rejects the ease of over-explanation and allure of an exclusively reverential tone. She reaches for honesty, and what she uncovers is at once disquieting and deeply absorbing.","May 18, 2024"
On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,2024,Variety,90,Guy Lodge,"Blending molasses-dark comedy with searing poetic realism to capture contemporary Zambian society at a generational impasse between staunch tradition and social progress, this is palpably new, future-minded filmmaking, at once intrepidly daring and rigorously poised.","May 18, 2024"
On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,2024,New York Magazine (Vulture),90,Bilge Ebiri,"The off-kilter, absurdist vibe of the picture is enchanting, but it’s rooted in deep horror: The whole movie is about the ways that cruelty and injustice become codified. Sometimes, the only way to preserve your sanity is to go a little insane yourself.","Jun 6, 2024"
On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,2024,The New York Times,90,Manohla Dargis,"[Nyoni] says all she needs to with each lapidary image, with every resonant silence and with the undaunted power of Shula’s gaze.","Mar 6, 2025"
On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,2024,Rolling Stone,90,David Fear,"There are surreal and absurdist touches throughout Nyoni’s second feature, and like the Zambian filmmaker’s awe-inspiring debut, I Am Not a Witch (2017), it proves she has a perfect sense of how to blend no-nonsense realism with its more magical counterpart.","Mar 7, 2025"
On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,2024,Los Angeles Times,90,Robert Abele,"In its atmosphere of gnawing discomfort with imposed secrecy about bad men, “On Becoming a Guinea Fowl” is a uniquely dimensional work of character and temporality. Nyoni’s brilliance is in portraying the gap between public and private, past and present, as spaces where submerged feelings awkwardly co-exist, leaving nobody able to feel truly whole.","Mar 9, 2025"
On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,2024,Arizona Republic,90,Bill Goodykoontz,"On Becoming a Guinea Fowl is not the first film about family secrets coming to light through grief, but it may be the most original.","Mar 19, 2025"
On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,2024,The Associated Press,88,Lindsey Bahr,"Nyoni and her cinematographer David Gallego make this a transportive, stylish and unforgettable experience that powerfully transcends the specifics of its setting, while also taking audiences into an culture that’s likely unfamiliar.","Mar 5, 2025"

On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,2024,TheWrap,81,Steve Pond,"The film can be confusing, but it’s not meant to be pinned down. And despite the occasionally surreal touches, it’s an examination of how the beauty of tradition can also be an opponent to justice and humanity.","May 18, 2024"
On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,2024,Little White Lies,80,Hannah Strong,"Anchored by Susan Chardy’s restrained performance, On Becoming A Guinea Fowl might touch on hot-button themes of sexual violence, misogyny and familial cycles of abuse, but Rungano Nyoni finds her own intriguing language to explore them.","Dec 5, 2024"

On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,2024,The Observer (UK),80,Wendy Ide,"Nyoni’s Zambia-set film, using the Bemba language and English, deftly juggles humour with pathos, domestic drama with surreal fantasy flourishes. It’s dizzyingly creative and rather special.","Dec 16, 2024"
On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,2024,Empire,80,Kambole Campbell,"Rungano Nyoni is one of the most exciting voices in cinema today and On Becoming a Guinea Fowl is abject proof: a disquieting, blistering examination of a family where social status trumps blood ties.","Jan 2, 2025"
On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,2024,Collider,80,Jeff Ewing,"It's anchored by a wonderful central performance from Susan Chardy, who finds layers of nuance in Shula as her anger over the situation bubbles to the surface.

On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,2024,The Guardian,60,Peter Bradshaw,"While it’s such an intriguing idea, an almost absurdist scrutiny of what avoidance looks like and how families choreograph their collective denial, there is something a little bit contrived in it and, though always engaged, I found myself longing for some outright passion or rage or confrontation.","May 18, 2024"
Mickey 17,2025,The Independent,100,Clarisse Loughrey,"For all the cruelty and buffoonery that might surround his hero, Bong lets us in on a revelation: what we’re really watching is a man learning that it’s OK for him to be happy.","Feb 15, 2025"
Mickey 17,2025,Total Film,100,David Opie,"Mickey 17 is funny and charming from the get-go, building out a fascinating sci-fi world from its central conceit that ends up speaking to powerful and timely concerns through humour, satire and exhilarating genre elements. Bong Joon-ho's best English movie to date and arguably Robert Pattinson's best movie ever.","Feb 15, 2025"
Mickey 17,2025,The New York Times,100,Manohla Dargis,"Bong keeps things zipping along, and with such nimbleness that the movie’s heavier ideas never weigh it down. He jabs rather than pounds as he takes on targets — authoritarianism, comic-book heroics, the vanity of power — while playfully mixing moods and acting styles.","Mar 6, 2025"
Mickey 17,2025,IndieWire,91,David Ehrlich,"This isn’t just another great Bong Joon Ho movie about how much he hates capitalism (though it definitely is that too), it’s the first Bong Joon Ho movie about how much he loves people.","Feb 15, 2025"

Mickey 17,2025,Slashfilm,90,BJ Colangelo,"Mickey 17 crystalizes our horrific reality into an existential parable, one that fundamentally understands the hell of working-class existence with the allegorical precision of ""The Twilight Zone."" It's a story about people finding love, connection, and community under hopeless circumstances, and a rallying cry that we all deserve better conditions for existing.","Feb 15, 2025"
Mickey 17,2025,Slate,90,Dana Stevens,"Above all, Mickey 17 is remarkable for the savagery of its satire of 21st-century capitalism.","Mar 6, 2025"
Mickey 17,2025,Austin Chronicle,89,Kimberley Jones,"Pattinson is fully committed to the performance – performances – and his impact subtly evolves from giggling to genuinely moving.

Mickey 17,2025,New York Magazine (Vulture),80,Alison Willmore,"Bong specializes in crushing capitalist dystopias, whether he’s skewering present-day South Korea or an even more stratified post-apocalyptic society, and the near-future in which Mickey 17 takes place is perverse enough for each detail to constitute its own dark joke.","Feb 15, 2025"
Mickey 17,2025,The Telegraph,80,Robbie Collin,"Mickey 17, about a hapless clone’s misadventures on a colonising mission, is a throwback to blockbusters as the late 20th century made ’em: a $100m boisterous sci-fi satire that neither belongs to a franchise nor cares to start one, but instead jams as many eggs as it can into one increasingly precarious basket.","Feb 15, 2025"
Mickey 17,2025,Empire,80,Helen O'Hara,"Like Mickey himself, it’s goofy and a little inconsistent, but it’s also funny, thoughtful and more plausible than we might like. A charming space oddity for these unusual times.","Feb 15, 2025"
Mickey 17,2025,Time Out,80, Lou Thomas,"Mickey 17 may lack some of the political bite of his previous work – though there are Trumpian elements in Marshall – but it’s unquestionably tremendous fun: a big, strange spectacle that’s unlike most blockbuster cinema out there.","Feb 15, 2025"
Mickey 17,2025,The Times,80,Kevin Maher,"He may have developed, produced and directed just one movie — this boisterous Robert Pattinson sci-fi comedy — but, yikes, has he packed a lot into Mickey 17.","Feb 17, 2025"
Mickey 17,2025,IGN,80,Siddhant Adlakha,"A deeply depressing comedic experience (thanks at least in part to accidental political timing), Bong’s remix of Edward Ashton’s novel presents a Trump-like villain and no worthy heroes, resulting in a farcical sci-fi adventure whose symbolism makes up for its misshapen character drama.","Feb 19, 2025"

Mickey 17,2025,The New Yorker,80,Justin Chang,"Even if DNA and memories could be duplicated at will, Bong suggests, individual morality would remain a glorious uncertainty principle, too human and singular to be nailed down.

Mickey 17,2025,Arizona Republic,80,Amanda Luberto,"Balanced with the over-the-top but spot-on performances by Ruffalo and Collette as the clear “rich guy turned politician that has a really really loyal fanbase” stand-in, ""Mickey 17"" is one of Bong’s best English-language films.","Mar 5, 2025"

Mickey 17,2025,TheWrap,77,Ben Croll,"The film, in short, exhilarates and exhausts in equal measure, abundant in ambition and arduous, at points, in execution.

Mickey 17,2025,The Seattle Times,75,Soren Andersen,"Bong covered many of the same aspects of “Mickey” in his 2013 sci-fi epic “Snowpiercer,” a more streamlined and hard-bitten work of social commentary with the have-nots battling the heedless rich. ”Mickey 17” is less focused and not quite as satisfying a production as that earlier movie.","Mar 5, 2025"

Mickey 17,2025,San Francisco Chronicle,75,G. Allen Johnson,"Bong has an original vision and a distinctive style that’s not to be dismissed. He’s our era’s Terry Gilliam, where hope pushes through the tragicomic nihilism.","Mar 5, 2025"

Mickey 17,2025,USA Today,75,Brian Truitt,"If this is Bong’s take on a Hollywood space blockbuster, it’s better than most. “Mickey 17,” led by a quirky underdog, offers a timely escape where empathy can overcome cruelty on the other side of the galaxy.","Mar 6, 2025"
Mickey 17,2025,Washington Post,75,Ty Burr,"It’s [Bong Joon Ho's] first film since “Parasite” became the first foreign language movie to win a best picture Oscar in 2020, and while it’s not his best work, “Mickey 17” is still a great deal of acrid fun. In the bargain, you get three great performances from two very good actors.","Mar 6, 2025"
Mickey 17,2025,Screen Daily,70,Tim Grierson,"Mickey 17 sometimes wobbles balancing its different tones.

Mickey 17,2025,Los Angeles Times,70,Amy Nicholson,"As semi-inessential as Mickey 17 feels in Bong’s canon, I’m at peace that he keeps asking how to give everyone’s life value. He’ll keep repeating the question until we come up with an answer.","Mar 7, 2025"

Mickey 17,2025,Looper,60,Alistair Ryder,"It's the weakest of his three English language efforts due to it feeling like he's watering down his satirical approach, spoon-feeding exposition to his audience alongside each joke under the worry that the parody might go over their heads.","Feb 15, 2025"
Mickey 17,2025,The Daily Beast,60,Nick Schager,"No matter a committed performance (two, actually) from Robert Pattinson, it’s an original that plays like a rehash—and an underwhelmingly unfunny one at that.","Mar 5, 2025"

Mickey 17,2025,Variety,50,Peter Debruge,"Though it earns points for sheer oddity (and the nearly monochromatic, future-noir look established by DP Darius Khondji and production designer Fiona Crombie), too much of “Mickey 17” turns out to be sloppy, shrill and preachy — ironically, the same things that make Mark Ruffalo’s deliberately Trump-styled villain so grating in this movie.","Feb 15, 2025"
Three Colours: Red,1994,San Francisco Chronicle,100,Edward Guthmann,"Red is the best of the lot: warmer, more accessible, unusually generous toward its characters. A mystical tale of chance encounters and unexpected connections, Red uses a traffic accident as a springboard to discovery.",
Three Colours: Red,1994,Chicago Sun-Times,100,Roger Ebert,"This is the kind of film that makes you feel intensely alive while you're watching it, and sends you out into the streets afterwards eager to talk deeply and urgently, to the person you are with. Whoever that happens to be.",
Three Colours: Red,1994,The New York Times,100,Janet Maslin,"Red succeeds so stirringly that it also bestows some much-needed magic upon its predecessors, ""Blue"" and ""White.""

Three Colours: Red,1994,ReelViews,100,James Berardinelli,"Red, the final chapter of Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colors trilogy, is a subtle masterpiece.

Three Colours: Red,1994,Variety,100,Lisa Nesselson,"Red, the beautifully spun and splendidly acted tale of a young model’s decisive encounter with a retired judge, is another deft, deeply affecting variation on Krzysztof Kieslowski’s recurring theme that people are interconnected in ways they can barely fathom. If it’s true — as the helmer has announced — that this opus will be his last foray into film directing, Kieslowski retires at a formal and philosophical peak.",
Three Colours: Red,1994,The Guardian,100,Peter Bradshaw,"With music by Zbigniew Preisner, it is an almost supernatural contrivance: brooding on coincidence, fate and the insoluble mystery of other people’s lives, with some cosmic parallels and existential echoes that recall his earlier film The Double Life of Véronique.

Take Shelter,2011,Time Out,100,Keith Uhlich,"Nichols has said that the idea for the film emerged from a free-floating anxiety that he sensed in the world at large, the feeling that everything we treasure in life could be lost in an instant.

Club,83,Noel Murray,"Writer-director Jeff Nichols re-teams with his ""Shotgun Stories"" star Michael Shannon for his second feature, Take Shelter, which has a similar setting, but a different mood. Nichols is still concerned with family legacies, and the ways people in smaller communities relate to each other, but Take Shelter is slower and smoother, deliberately developing a mood of creeping dread.","Sep 28, 2011"
Take Shelter,2011,Variety,80,Justin Chang,"This deliberately paced psychological drama builds an ever-tightening knot of tension around an excellent Michael Shannon, here playing a family man slowly driven mad by apocalyptic visions that could be paranoid, prophetic or both.","Sep 25, 2011"
Take Shelter,2011,Los Angeles Times,80,Sheri Linden,"From the first moments of the eerie storm that opens the story, dread is the prevailing mood of this pre-apocalyptic drama - a film very much about this moment in time.","Sep 29, 2011"
Take Shelter,2011,The New York Times,80,A.O. Scott,"It is a quiet, relentless exploration of the latent (and not so latent) terrors that bedevil contemporary American life, a horror movie that will trouble your sleep not with visions of monsters but with a more familiar dread.","Sep 29, 2011"
Take Shelter,2011,New York Daily News,80,Elizabeth Weitzman,"Nichols approaches his subject with thoughtful empathy, and while his themes are enormous - he's addressing no less than the state of our nation - he wisely underplays even the most important moments.","Sep 30, 2011"
Take Shelter,2011,Empire,80,Angie Errigo,Terrific. Michael Shannon delivers a fractured everyman who'll stay with you long after the final frame.,"Nov 21, 2011"
Take Shelter,2011,Austin Chronicle,78,Marjorie Baumgarten,"Take Shelter is a deeply unsettling movie. Writer/director Jeff Nichols (an Austin resident and director of the award-winning 2007 feature ""Shotgun Stories"") doles out information as strategically as a government official.","Oct 27, 2011"
Take Shelter,2011,Slant Magazine,75,Bill Weber,"It's not easy to give a character study concerning mental illness the aspect of

Take Shelter,2011,New Orleans Times-Picayune,70,Mike Scott,"All in all, Nichols ends up with a richly drawn, and at times disturbing, portrait of one man's descent into madness.","Nov 6, 2011"
Take Shelter,2011,New York Post,63,Lou Lumenick,It would be possible to appreciate Shannon's fabulous work in Take Shelter far better if the filmmaker lost a quarter of the two-hour running time -- there are many overlong scenes that make this a needlessly tough sit.,"Sep 30, 2011"
Take Shelter,2011,San Francisco Chronicle,50,Mick LaSalle,"Take Shelter has a problem, the simplest of all problems but no less serious for its being simple. It's a film without suspense and with a slow-moving story that unfolds without surprise or embellishment.","Oct 6, 2011"

Universal Language,2024,Original-Cin,100,Liam Lacey,"In short, Universal Language is something of bag of mixed nuts, a Frankenfilm, a cinematic turducken, with comic non-sequiturs and sight gags linked by three narrative strands.","Feb 6, 2025"
Universal Language,2024,RogerEbert.com,100,Monica Castillo,"Co-written by Rankin, Nemati, and Ila Firouzabadi, “Universal Language” is delightfully absurdist, with little moments in each story that both make sense yet defy expectations.","Feb 14, 2025"
Universal Language,2024,Rolling Stone,100,David Fear,"There is no single category that you can slot Rankin’s mix of a wink, a nudge and an embrace into, so we guess “lo-fi masterpiece” will have to do until a better option comes along.","Feb 14, 2025"

Universal Language,2024,Collider,90,Jason Gorber,"The story navigates the fine line between community pride and nationalistic zeal, providing lessons for a future while admitting to the existential futility of it all.

Universal Language,2024,The New York Times,90,Alissa Wilkinson,"It’s a pensive meditation in an era of displacement, even if the film never tries to make a big point.

Universal Language,2024,The Associated Press,88,Jake Coyle,"Rankin’s film, his second following the also surreal “Twentieth Century” (2019), is propelled less by narrative thrust than the abiding oddity of its basic construction, and the movie’s slavish devotion to seeing it through without a wink.","Feb 18, 2025"

Universal Language,2024,The A.V. Club,83,Jacob Oller,"To further dig into Rankin’s blending of the goofily left-field and the openly earnest, the message persisting through the dry punchlines is that to care for your neighbor, to care for all the oddities of home, is to care for yourself.","Feb 12, 2025"
Universal Language,2024,Variety,80,Peter Debruge,"Rankin may have conceived Universal Language in the spirit of homage, but there’s something undeniably original about the end result. Don’t be surprised if that translates into a modest cult following and more creative ideas in the future.","May 25, 2024"
Universal Language,2024,Film Threat,80,Andy Howell,"The film is so gloriously absurd that we are mainly driven through the narrative by the continuous reveal of new elements in this bizarre and hilarious universe. Still, when everything does come together at the end, there are some emotional payoffs that sneak up on you like a wandering turkey.","Oct 11, 2024"
Universal Language,2024,The Hollywood Reporter,80,Jordan Mintzer,"Rankin seems to be seeking out the universal language of cinema itself.

Universal Language,2024,Los Angeles Times,80,Amy Nicholson,"The tone is dry and spartan — and funny, too, if you don’t mind snorting at someone whose sons died in a marshmallow-eating competition, or giggling over the sobs of a worker weeping in a cubicle for reasons that go unexplained.","Feb 14, 2025"
Universal Language,2024,The Film Verdict,75,Stephen Dalton,"Blending autobiographical elements with heartfelt homages to Iranian cinema, writer-director Matthew Rankin's charmingly surreal comic fable reimagines Canada as a Farsi-speaking dreamland.","May 25, 2024"
Universal Language,2024,Slant Magazine,75,David Robb,"Though juxtaposing Canada’s drabness and relative lack of heritage with Iran’s millennia of unbroken tradition brings out the former aspects particularly clearly, Universal Language is aiming beyond mere satire or culture-clash playfulness.","Sep 8, 2024"
Universal Language,2024,Washington Post,75,Ty Burr,"It is as far from the commercial mainstream as narrative filmmaking gets, but for connoisseurs of the poetic bizarre, it has its very real enchantments.","Feb 28, 2025"
Universal Language,2024,The New Yorker,70,Justin Chang,"[Rankin’s] film, at its best when it expresses a sincere belief in the possibilities of human connection, can feel trapped in the margins of its conceit, short-circuited by movie love.","Feb 13, 2025"
Universal Language,2024,Screen Daily,60,Fionnuala Halligan,You could call it whimsical. Absurdist. Contrived. Or an unexpectedly unusual concept album that doesn’t quite come off but was worth the effort. And you would be correct every time.,"May 25, 2024"
Universal Language,2024,Wall Street Journal,50,Kyle Smith,"The oblique nature of the final act might perhaps be justified if the rest of the movie were better.

Nickel Boys,2024,The Hollywood Reporter,100,Lovia Gyarkye,"Ross, honoring the perspective shift that characterizes Whitehead’s novel, switches between Elwood and Turner’s points of view, remaining, at all times, in the subjective mode.

Nickel Boys,2024,IndieWire,100,David Ehrlich,"Pure sense and subjectivity in a way that evokes the same visual magic of Ross’ documentary work, Nickel Boys so viscerally and fundamentally centers the experience of its young Black characters that even the most racist brand of revisionist history could never hope to deny their truth.","Sep 1, 2024"
Nickel Boys,2024,Screen Daily,100,Fionnuala Halligan,"Nickel Boys is about societal evil, certainly, and carries a score which almost bites the skin of the audience as a reminder of that pain, but it is the tenderness at its core that deals the emotional blow.","Sep 27, 2024"

Nickel Boys,2024,The New York Times,100,Manohla Dargis,"Part of what makes Nickel Boys striking is how Ross stays true to the novel but with his own voice, his own narrative and visual style, and how he uses moments in time and freighted images — faces, hands, flashing police lights, an alligator in a class, a mule in a hall — to build the story.","Dec 12, 2024"
Nickel Boys,2024,The Associated Press,100,Lindsey Bahr,"The threads do come together, but it requires a bit of patience and giving yourself over to the film, which is both formally and emotionally eye-opening.

Nickel Boys,2024,The New Yorker,90,Richard Brody,"In a year of audaciously accomplished movies, “Nickel Boys” stands out as different in kind.

Nickel Boys,2024,Movie Nation,88,Roger Moore,"Nickel Boys is American history, Southern history and Florida history uncovered and exposed, and a cautionary lesson to a culture backsliding into the comfort of more and more lies and delusions, all served up in one of the most artful films of 2024.","Jan 19, 2025"
Nickel Boys,2024,Paste Magazine,84,Jesse Hassenger,"Though Nickel Boys is at least in part about Black oppression and the suffering that comes along with it, Ross uses the movie’s point of view to avoid making a movie that turns that suffering into a marquee attraction or an endurance test.","Oct 9, 2024"
Nickel Boys,2024,The A.V. Club,83,Tomris Laffly,"Ross’ formal dedication sometimes stands in the way of story and emotion, prioritizing visuals over earned moments of expressive, swelling feelings. And so this critic did wonder if Nickel Boys should have dialed up its narrative ambitions from time to time, stepping just a bit away from its creative non-fiction temperaments.","Sep 1, 2024"
Nickel Boys,2024,The Telegraph,80,Tim Robey,"Rightly treating the book as a new American classic, Ross doesn’t try to supplant it so much as do the best possible job of illustrating it: a deference to the source that makes his film a modest triumph.","Oct 16, 2024"
Nickel Boys,2024,The Irish Times,80,Tara Brady,A series of indelible images coalesce into a powerful chronicle of institutional abuse and racial inequality.,"Jan 2, 2025"
Nickel Boys,2024,The Globe and Mail (Toronto),80,Aparita Bhandari,"It’s hard to describe Nickel Boys. It seems like an injustice to call it, simply, a film. It’s a remarkable piece of art, even more impressive when you consider that it’s photographer and filmmaker RaMell Ross’s debut feature film – in fiction.","Jan 10, 2025"
Nickel Boys,2024,NME,80,Hollie Geraghty,"While the narrative never quite makes peace in the way you would expect and does meander slightly off course, it seems Ross had no intention of a textbook crescendo.","Feb 28, 2025"
Nickel Boys,2024,Austin Chronicle,78,Richard Whittaker,"If anything, Ross’ work reminds us that the camera need not be God’s unblinking eye on a story. He has crafted an exceptional film driven by captivating performances.","Jan 9, 2025"
Nickel Boys,2024,ReelViews,75,James Berardinelli,"Nickel Boys has a lot to recommend it, but there’s a sense that the experience could have been more devastating had the filmmakers simply let it play out rather than using it as an opportunity for directorial flourishes and experimentation.","Dec 12, 2024"
Nickel Boys,2024,San Francisco Chronicle,75,Michael Ordoña,Nickel Boys offers a different way to understand horrors based on true events not that far in the past by plunging viewers into its characters’ humanity.,"Jan 2, 2025"
Nickel Boys,2024,LarsenOnFilm,75,Josh Larsen,Nickel Boys overflows with formal ingenuity and daring.,"Jan 30, 2025"
Nickel Boys,2024,The Playlist,67,Gregory Ellwood,"It’s somewhat remarkable a new work exists that sparks such conversation in the first place. Even if it doesn’t completely succeed, that’s art. That’s dynamic. That deserves your attention.","Sep 4, 2024"
Nickel Boys,2024,Variety,60,Peter Debruge,"For the first hour or so, Nickel Boys feels like the most exciting narrative debut since “Beasts of the Southern Wild.” Then Ross tries something bold that doesn’t quite work, and the experiment collapses upon itself.","Sep 2, 2024"
Nickel Boys,2024,Time,60,Stephanie Zacharek,"Nickel Boys is a picture on the move, a work that’s traveling forward, the thing we always ask for yet often don’t know how to accept when it arrives.","Dec 16, 2024"
Nickel Boys,2024,The Daily Beast,55,Nick Schager,"Its formal showmanship unconvincing and off-putting, the film is a case study in the hazards of prizing style over substance.","Sep 27, 2024"
Nickel Boys,2024,Wall Street Journal,30,Kyle Smith,"Repetitive, meandering and dull, Mr. Ross’s film keeps steering attention to its director at the expense of narrative by relying on two tics that quickly wear out their welcome.","Dec 12, 2024"
