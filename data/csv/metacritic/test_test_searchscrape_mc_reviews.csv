I'M STILL HERE,2024,,The New York Times,100,Alissa Wilkinson,"I’m Still Here does not present as a simple polemic about a historical and political situation, and that’s the secret to its global appeal. It’s also a moving portrait of how politics disrupts and reshapes the domestic sphere, and how solidarity, community and love are the only viable path toward living in tragedy. And it warns us to mistrust anyone who tries to erase or rewrite the past.","Jan 16, 2025"
I'M STILL HERE,2024,,RogerEbert.com,100,Robert Daniels,"It’s difficult to fully contextualize how incredible Torres is here; she matches the film’s silent grief by keenly deploying her character’s internal angst into her slender frame. Through her formidable presence, the deliberate “I’m Still Here,” a film that locates further meaning in the face of Brazil’s present Far-Right wave, remains in the heart long after the picture fades.","Jan 16, 2025"

I'M STILL HERE,2024,,Chicago Sun-Times,100,Richard Roeper,"Based on a true story, this is a tribute to the strength of a matriarch who doesn’t have time to grieve or feel sorry for herself. She has children to love and protect.","Jan 22, 2025"
I'M STILL HERE,2024,,Washington Post,100,Ty Burr,Walter Salles’s “I’m Still Here” is an epic within an epic: a teeming family drama contained within the melodrama of a country going insane.,"Jan 23, 2025"
I'M STILL HERE,2024,,Original-Cin,100,Liam Lacey,"In I’m Still Here, Walter Salles’ first feature film in a dozen years, the Brazilian director manages an impressive feat of teleporting, placing the viewer inside the cheerful chaos of a large Brazilian family.","Jan 30, 2025"
I'M STILL HERE,2024,,The Globe and Mail (Toronto),100,Anne T. Donahue,"I’m Still Here is a timely, exquisite masterpiece.","Feb 5, 2025"
I'M STILL HERE,2024,,The Seattle Times,100,Moira Macdonald,"This mesmerizing film is a tribute to an astonishing woman and a timely reminder of a dark period in a country’s history.

I'M STILL HERE,2024,,The Observer (UK),100,Wendy Ide,"The realisation that her husband is gone for good is a gradual process that plays out, largely without words, on Torres’s face, in a performance of extraordinary intelligence and emotional complexity.","Feb 26, 2025"
I'M STILL HERE,2024,,The A.V. Club,91,Manuel Betancourt,"Heartrending yet never maudlin, I’m Still Here is a humanist drama that, in shining a light on insidious injustice, becomes a balm to warn and warm its audiences in equal measure.","Jan 14, 2025"
I'M STILL HERE,2024,,The Hollywood Reporter,90,David Rooney,"I’m Still Here is a gripping, profoundly touching film with a deep well of pathos. It’s one of Salles’ best.","Sep 4, 2024"
I'M STILL HERE,2024,,Screen Daily,90,Wendy Ide,"Salles never over-labours the film’s emotional beats, relying instead on Torres’ magnificent, intricately layered performance to drive the picture.","Sep 4, 2024"
I'M STILL HERE,2024,,Collider,90,Emma Kiely,"The chemistry between all of the Paira family members forms the beating heart of the film, devastating the audience by reminding them how happy they used to be, but promising them that nothing can shatter their sense of spirit, because they are together.","Oct 15, 2024"
I'M STILL HERE,2024,,Little White Lies,90,Rafaela Sales Ross,I’m Still Here triumphs in pairing Salles’s intrinsic understanding of the emotional potential of realism with two brilliant performers in Mello and Torres.,"Feb 20, 2025"

I'M STILL HERE,2024,,Chicago Tribune,88,Michael Phillips,"Torres is one of those screen veterans with a surgically precise relationship to the camera, never pushing, always searching for emotions expressed even as they’re being hidden, or held in check, because someone’s watching.","Jan 27, 2025"
I'M STILL HERE,2024,,LarsenOnFilm,88,Josh Larsen,"Torres gives a performance that gains strength even as Eunice increasingly trembles; this is no stoic, generic portrait of resilience, but one that’s always counting the cost.","Jan 27, 2025"
I'M STILL HERE,2024,,Boston Globe,88,Odie Henderson,"Director Walter Salles returns to the political filmmaking he employed in the 2004 Che Guevara film, “The Motorcycle Diaries.” Like that film, this one follows a protagonist who becomes an activist after being jarred by political events.","Jan 30, 2025"
I'M STILL HERE,2024,,Paste Magazine,87,Jason Gorber,"Walter Salles’ latest, and most accomplished film, I’m Still Here, allows international audiences into this world of quiet resilience and powerful response to the whims of a dictatorial regime.","Feb 10, 2025"

I'M STILL HERE,2024,,Time Out,80,Phil de Semlyen,"I’m Still Here takes you right into the machinery of a repressive regime, showing just enough of its dank jail cells and casual cruelties without overwhelming its deeper story of loss.","Sep 10, 2024"
I'M STILL HERE,2024,,Rolling Stone,80,David Fear,"What’s remarkable is how [Torres] never overplays anything, or goes for easy histrionics and rending of garments even when the movie itself becomes heavy-handed in the back half.","Jan 17, 2025"
I'M STILL HERE,2024,,TheWrap,80,Chase Hutchinson,"As Salles shows us, such a seismic loss spans many generations just as it does entire histories that are still being written.

I'M STILL HERE,2024,,The Atlantic,80,David Sims,"That unsettling feeling is communicated by Torres’s devastating, genuine performance.","Jan 24, 2025"

I'M STILL HERE,2024,,IndieWire,75,Leila Latif,"The idea of them getting justice never feels on the table, but the film instead is a path out of the madness of a system where to simply have what happened to their father admitted would fill some of the void he has left behind.","Sep 2, 2024"

I'M STILL HERE,2024,,Movie Nation,75,Roger Moore,Torres is so subtle at portraying a mother unable to show panic or righteous rage that when Eunice finally does let her guard down it’s almost shocking. It’s a great performance.,"Feb 10, 2025"

I'M STILL HERE,2024,,The New Yorker,70,Justin Chang,"It was shrewd of the screenwriters, Murilo Hauser and Heitor Lorega, to stick so closely to Eunice’s perspective, trusting the audience to identify with her uncertainty, her vulnerability, and her instinctive urge to protect her children.

I'M STILL HERE,2024,,Empire,60,Gavia Baker-Whitelaw,"This drama is a little too sedate to make its mark, but director Walter Salles delivers a sensitive portrait of Eunice Paiva's family life during a period of traumatic upheaval.","Feb 19, 2025"
I'M STILL HERE,2024,,The Playlist,58,Marshall Shaffer,"Given the unhurried pacing and general underplaying of the situation’s gravity, the film feels like visiting a museum exhibit rather than living through a flashpoint of history. Here, the past’s horrors are but pictures nestled safely behind glass.","Sep 2, 2024"
I'M STILL HERE,2024,,The Film Stage,50,Savina Petkova,"On this occasion Salles has somehow failed to find the right cinematic framework for this biopic storytelling. The film feels uncalibrated, but not in the free-flowing, depth-exploring, liberated kind of way.","Sep 2, 2024"
I'M STILL HERE,2024,,Slant Magazine,50,Cole Kronman,"The film has trouble excavating any coarse humanism from this decidedly human story, opting instead to paint the family at its center in broad, uninspired strokes.","Oct 9, 2024"
