TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Screen Daily,100,John Hazelton,Tangerine paints a portrait of transgender sex workers and their clients that pulses with raunchy energy and compassionate humour. It’s a bracing slice of American indie film-making.,"Jul 7, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Los Angeles Times,100,Rebecca Keegan,"With a witty and efficient script by director Sean Baker and co-writer Chris Bergoch, Tangerine peels back the curtain on a fascinating Los Angeles microculture.","Jul 9, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,The New York Times,100,Manohla Dargis,"Tangerine encompasses dizzying multitudes — it’s a neo-screwball chase flick with a dash of Rainer Werner Fassbinder — but mostly, movingly, it is a female-friendship movie about two people who each started life with an XY chromosome set.","Jul 9, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,New York Magazine (Vulture),100,David Edelstein,"What’s extraordinary about Tangerine is that it’s everything an entertaining, old-fashioned, mainstream Hollywood comedy should be but no longer is. That nowadays you have to get this kind of stuff via Sundance from directors using iPhones is a drag — the wrong kind.","Jul 9, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,San Francisco Chronicle,100,David Lewis,"This is sublime filmmaking, a textbook example of how indies can tell groundbreaking stories in a way that Hollywood simply can’t match.","Jul 16, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Slate,100,Dana Stevens,"A sneaky slice-of-life indie that comes on all casual and cinéma-verité in the early scenes, then slowly coalesces into a romantic comedy as intricately constructed as any door-slamming stage farce.","Jul 21, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Time Out,100,David Ehrlich,"A saturated picture that courses with the raw energy of found footage while still feeling artfully composed, a movie that punches with the skittering violence of dubstep but careens through L.A. with the unbridled freedom of bebop jazz.","Jul 21, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Salon,100,Andrew O'Hehir,"This is a gorgeous, timely and possibly profound human comedy, and if there’s no disentangling the medium from the message that’s because both are powerful and ambiguous.","Jul 21, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,The Telegraph,100,Robbie Collin,"It radiates a candour, immediacy and tongue-scalding sex appeal that a bigger budget would have only smothered.","Nov 15, 2015"

TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Entertainment Weekly,91,Joe McGovern,Tangerine is touching for its non-condescending stance toward working girls and the spirit of the sidewalk.,"Jul 7, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,The Hollywood Reporter,90,David Rooney,"The film's smart craftsmanship is ultimately less noteworthy than its humanizing, prejudice-challenging immersion into the lives of people who inhabit L.A.'s low-end drug and sex industry.","Jan 31, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Variety,90,Justin Chang,"Writer-director Sean Baker’s sun-scorched, street-level snapshot is a work of rueful, matter-of-fact insight and unapologetically wild humor that draws a motley collection of funny, sad and desperate individuals into its protagonists’ orbit.","Jan 31, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Village Voice,90,Stephanie Zacharek,"In the early minutes you might not be sure what you're watching. Tangerine's a comedy, of course, laced with rambunctious, exuberantly ragged dialogue. But by the end, Baker and his actors have led us to a place beyond comedy — you may still be laughing, but your breath catches a little on the way out.","Jul 7, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,New York Post,88,Sara Stewart,"The two working girls at the center of Tangerine are played by engaging newcomers: Kitana Kiki Rodriguez as the freshly out-of-jail Sin-Dee Rella, and Mya Taylor as her best friend Alexandra.","Jul 8, 2015"

TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Philadelphia Inquirer,88,Steven Rea,"Baker gets great, sly, unforced performances from his two leads, but it's not all a rollicking good time: There are moments of quietude, inquietude, moments when a sense of wariness and loneliness settles over the women.","Jul 24, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,The A.V. Club,83,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,"It’s the movie’s quietest, softest moments that register most strongly, be it Alexandra’s low-key performance of Victor Herbert’s “Toyland” to an almost empty bar, or the final scene, which finds her and Sin-Dee alone in a Laundromat at the end of a long, bad night.","Jul 8, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Portland Oregonian,83,Marc Mohan,"Baker's previous films ""Take Out"" and ""Starlet"" have focused on populations generally treated with disdain by mainstream society -- illegal immigrants and porn performers, respectively. With Tangerine he continues to prove that by depicting these characters in all their flaws and majesty, movies can inspire awareness of our shared humanity. And make us laugh.","Jul 17, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Wall Street Journal,80,Joe Morgenstern,The film is clearly not for everyone; sometimes it wasn’t for me. But it’s steadfastly nonjudgmental and wonderfully tender toward two searchers for new versions of old-fashioned love.,"Jul 9, 2015"

TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,CineVue,80,Patrick Gamble,"Poetic realism for a digital age, Tangerine also shares a lot of qualities with the cinema of Mike Leigh and Ken Loach. There's no cheap manipulation here and Baker's characters never come across as victims.","Nov 15, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Austin Chronicle,78,Steve Davis,"Tangerine’s greatest accomplishment, however, lies with director Baker, who filmed the movie using an iPhone 5S. It’s an amazing achievement – the fluidity of the camerawork is exhilarating at times, the intimacy of the close-ups sometimes unsettling.","Jul 22, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Slant Magazine,75,Ed Gonzalez,"Its triumph is primarily a matter of style, a visionary revelation every bit as expressionistic as its main character's electric sense of shade.","Jun 28, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Movie Nation,75,Roger Moore,"A feisty, funny, down-and-dirty farce as nasty as a Supreme Court dissent, as timely as a Jenner magazine cover.","Jul 7, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,TheWrap,75,Inkoo Kang,"The film bustles along through a series of reveals – a storytelling technique that can lose an audience’s sympathy or suspension of disbelief pretty fast, but which works flawlessly here because the filmmakers and the performers know exactly who their characters are and what kind of world they live in.","Jul 9, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,RogerEbert.com,75,Matt Zoller Seitz,"As written by Sean Baker and Chris Bergoch and directed by Baker, it's assured and immensely likable, and truly independent in story and style.","Jul 10, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Washington Post,75,Ann Hornaday,"As one character observes in Tangerine, Los Angeles is “a beautifully wrapped lie.” Baker has created a fitting homage to artifice and the often tawdry, tender realities that lie beneath.","Jul 16, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,St. Louis Post-Dispatch,75,Calvin Wilson,"Although the story of Sin-Dee and Alexandra might have benefited from a bit more structure, it’s a window into a world of which many people are unaware — but a world that has its share of dreamers.","Aug 6, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,The New Yorker,70,Richard Brody,"Baker revels in the power of clichés and the generic energy of his low-fi cinematography, which is done with a cell phone. The results are picturesque and anecdotal.","Jul 7, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Boston Globe,63,Peter Keough,Subtlety and irony are not among the film’s virtues.,"Jul 16, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,New York Daily News,60,Jordan Hoffman,"Tangerine offers a warts-and-all depiction of a subculture seldom treated with respect by straight society. The movie handles it in a sincere way that’s entertaining, too.","Jul 9, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,New Orleans Times-Picayune,40,Mike Scott,"Like the rest of the film, it's has its laughs and it has its emotion, just not enough of either.","Sep 18, 2015"
Secret Mall Apartment,2025,Jeremy Workman,RogerEbert.com,88,Matt Zoller Seitz,"This is a delightful, thought-provoking movie that’s about a lot of things at the same time. It’ll make you see the world with fresh eyes, and probably wonder why there isn’t more art in it.","Mar 21, 2025"
Secret Mall Apartment,2025,Jeremy Workman,Paste Magazine,74,Jim Vorel,"It’s tough to watch Secret Mall Apartment and not fall under the spell of Townsend and his earnest collaborators, possessing as they do the idealism and righteous conviction of young people in a bygone era who are quite certain that they’re going to change the world.","Mar 24, 2025"

Secret Mall Apartment,2025,Jeremy Workman,New York Magazine (Vulture),70,Bilge Ebiri,"These are the intriguing ideas at work in Secret Mall Apartment, but the film works as a movie thanks to the sly way it’s been put together.","Mar 21, 2025"
Secret Mall Apartment,2025,Jeremy Workman,The New York Times,70,Alissa Wilkinson,"Secret Mall Apartment makes a compelling case that the project reverberates through the lives of the artists, and maybe even the city, to this day. Art doesn’t have to be in a museum to be valuable; it doesn’t have to be own-able, repeatable or even make sense to everyone. If it changes a few lives, then it’s changed the world.","Mar 28, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,The Independent,100,Clarisse Loughrey,"While the supporting cast are impeccable across the board, it’s really Blanchett and Fassbender’s film to command, with performances that drip with old-school star power.","Mar 6, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,The Seattle Times,100,Katie Walsh,"Black Bag may be rooted in the mind, but it is inextricably connected to the heart, especially in matters of love and trust, betrayal and murder. That’s what makes a Soderbergh genre exercise such a deliciously satisfying cinematic morsel: It is pure fun, but also deeply layered with larger existential themes, making for a delightful romantic spy drama that cannot be missed.","Mar 12, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,New York Magazine (Vulture),100,Angelica Jade Bastien,"Black Bag is a tremendous example that a film need not be making an explicit political point or obsessed with the political dimensions of its narrative to be worthwhile cinema. A work can rise to this present moment by offering us rapture. This, too, is what movies are meant to accomplish.","Mar 14, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,The New Yorker,100,Justin Chang,"Soderbergh and Koepp, for their part, express their own fervent belief: in the seductive glamour of espionage and the magnetism of Blanchett’s and Fassbender’s interlocking gazes—which is to say, in the enveloping artifice and power of movies. Great is their faithfulness indeed.","Mar 14, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,RogerEbert.com,100,Monica Castillo,"The result is absolutely delicious, a svelte piece of entertainment that feels like a vintage yarn yet very much represents our own current anxieties, questions of sustaining trust in relationships and high-stake careers.","Mar 14, 2025"

Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,Original-Cin,91,Jim Slotek,"There are not many films on the release schedule with good writing and plotting, wit and solid acting. That’s an exceptional combination in a quick bite of the spy movie genre.","Mar 13, 2025"

Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,Rolling Stone,90,David Fear,"It’s a great espionage thriller, and an even better scenes-from-a-marriage drama. Ian Fleming would love this. So would Ingmar Bergman.","Mar 12, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,The New York Times,90,Manohla Dargis,"By the time Pierce Brosnan shows up, you may find yourself giggling at the whole meta deliciousness of this enterprise.

Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,Arizona Republic,90,Bill Goodykoontz,"Black Bag, Steven Soderbergh’s outstanding new film, is sleek, cool, polished, smart, smooth — if Soderbergh were a thief, he’d leave no fingerprints.","Mar 13, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,Wall Street Journal,90,Kyle Smith,"Messrs. Soderbergh and Koepp have followed one of (Elmore) Leonard’s Laws—“Leave out the parts that people skip”—to construct an electric, fast-paced thriller that amounts to one climactic scene piled atop another.","Mar 14, 2025"

Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,The Associated Press,88,Jake Coyle,"Black Bag follows a run of agilely directed thrillers by Soderbergh made with screenwriter David Koepp. They are both at the height of their almost-too-easy powers; the script, especially, is peppered with delectable dialogue.","Mar 12, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,Chicago Sun-Times,88,Richard Roeper,"I’m not going to pretend I always knew exactly what everyone was talking about as we plunged ever deeper into the weeds of double-crossing and triple-crossing among a batch of mostly iniquitous secret agents, but it’s a zippy and darkly funny ride every step of the way. The dialogue jumps off the page, and the performances are universally brilliant.","Mar 13, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,Movie Nation,88,Roger Moore,"Koepp and Soderbergh make this as much about mistrust and fidelity in a marriage as it is about spies-gone-wrong. They keep their film intimate and interrogatory, giving it an old fashioned theatrical feel.","Mar 14, 2025"

Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,ReelViews,88,James Berardinelli,"Hollywood’s decision to abandon this kind of storytelling is one reason why cinema in the 2020s has fallen into the doldrums and, when something like Black Bag arrives, it’s a bittersweet reminder of the potential of the big screen experience.","Mar 14, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,The Globe and Mail (Toronto),88,Barry Hertz,"Blanchett, as always, is flawless as the seductive and secretive Kathryn, but it’s Fassbender who reveals a different side of himself.","Mar 14, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,LarsenOnFilm,88,Josh Larsen,"Written by David Koepp, who also penned Soderbergh’s Kimi and Presence, Black Bag displays the twists and intrigue you’d expect from a top-rate spy flick, along with some scintillating dialogue.

Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,The Film Verdict,85,Alonso Duralde,"Black Bag is a not-quite-quotidian spy movie.

Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,Looper,85,Dominic Griffin,"It's a sharp, sexy, and intoxicating drama that has more in common with Patrick Marber's play ""Closer"" than with most spook stories.","Mar 12, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,IGN,80,Siddhant Adlakha,"Its story of three couples working at the same British agency turns all the right screws with impeccable timing, forcing its characters to examine the flaws in their relationships as its tale of state secrets gradually unravels.","Mar 6, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,Paste Magazine,80,Jesse Hassenger,"Without slackening its tension, Black Bag sometimes resembles a bitter comedy of manners, which are apparently also kept in the black bag for certain stretches.

Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,Time,80,Stephanie Zacharek,"Black Bag succeeds on its chilly wit, and on the cool, nervy appeal of its two stars. Blanchett strides through the movie with lioness grace; Fassbender makes George’s robotic use of logic seem like an aphrodisiac.","Mar 6, 2025"

Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,Empire,80,John Nugent,"Its pleasures lie in the dialogue, the twists, the reveals. It all leads to a delightful Agatha Christie-style drawing room denouement, in which the rat is exposed, their best-laid plans laid to waste.

Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,Time Out,80,Phil de Semlyen,"With this quick-witted and sexually supercharged espionage caper, Steven Soderbergh and his screenwriter David Koepp (Jurassic Park) have just remade Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy for the Industry generation.","Mar 11, 2025"

Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,The Irish Times,80,Donald Clarke,"No doubt the unrelenting archness will annoy many. But, honed to an economic 93 minutes, Black Bag beats all the current worthless streaming thrillers for wit, pace, style and commitment to the bit.","Mar 12, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,Collider,80,Ross Bonaime,"With a delectable cast and Soderbergh and Koepp knowing exactly how to twist this story with each new scene and reveal, Black Bag is yet another example that Soderbergh can basically make any genre his own, and thrive in it.","Mar 12, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,ABC News,80,Peter Travers,"OK, Steven Soderbergh’s sleek, sexy spy thriller is sometimes too cool for school.

Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,The Telegraph,80,Robbie Collin,"It positions spycraft as a hybrid of occult ritual and parlour game – and perhaps also a grand-scale working-through of deep-seated national jitters. Happily, it’s also enormous fun with it, and has your mind whirring to keep up with David Koepp’s devious screenplay, which gives itself a head start and waits until the very end before willingly surrendering the lead.","Mar 14, 2025"

Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,IndieWire,75,David Ehrlich,"If Black Bag denies us the kind of duplicitous confrontations that other versions of this story might take pains to savor, Soderbergh’s aversion to giving audiences what they want — and the severe angularity that he tends to offer us now instead — is almost as rewarding here as it was utterly indefensible in “Magic Mike’s Last Dance.”","Mar 12, 2025"
Black Bag,2025,Steven Soderbergh,San Francisco Chronicle,75,G.
