TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Screen Daily,100,John Hazelton,Tangerine paints a portrait of transgender sex workers and their clients that pulses with raunchy energy and compassionate humour. It’s a bracing slice of American indie film-making.,"Jul 7, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Los Angeles Times,100,Rebecca Keegan,"With a witty and efficient script by director Sean Baker and co-writer Chris Bergoch, Tangerine peels back the curtain on a fascinating Los Angeles microculture.","Jul 9, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,The New York Times,100,Manohla Dargis,"Tangerine encompasses dizzying multitudes — it’s a neo-screwball chase flick with a dash of Rainer Werner Fassbinder — but mostly, movingly, it is a female-friendship movie about two people who each started life with an XY chromosome set.","Jul 9, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,New York Magazine (Vulture),100,David Edelstein,"What’s extraordinary about Tangerine is that it’s everything an entertaining, old-fashioned, mainstream Hollywood comedy should be but no longer is. That nowadays you have to get this kind of stuff via Sundance from directors using iPhones is a drag — the wrong kind.","Jul 9, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,San Francisco Chronicle,100,David Lewis,"This is sublime filmmaking, a textbook example of how indies can tell groundbreaking stories in a way that Hollywood simply can’t match.","Jul 16, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Slate,100,Dana Stevens,"A sneaky slice-of-life indie that comes on all casual and cinéma-verité in the early scenes, then slowly coalesces into a romantic comedy as intricately constructed as any door-slamming stage farce.","Jul 21, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Time Out,100,David Ehrlich,"A saturated picture that courses with the raw energy of found footage while still feeling artfully composed, a movie that punches with the skittering violence of dubstep but careens through L.A. with the unbridled freedom of bebop jazz.","Jul 21, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Salon,100,Andrew O'Hehir,"This is a gorgeous, timely and possibly profound human comedy, and if there’s no disentangling the medium from the message that’s because both are powerful and ambiguous.","Jul 21, 2015"

TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,The Hollywood Reporter,90,David Rooney,"The film's smart craftsmanship is ultimately less noteworthy than its humanizing, prejudice-challenging immersion into the lives of people who inhabit L.A.'s low-end drug and sex industry.","Jan 31, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Variety,90,Justin Chang,"Writer-director Sean Baker’s sun-scorched, street-level snapshot is a work of rueful, matter-of-fact insight and unapologetically wild humor that draws a motley collection of funny, sad and desperate individuals into its protagonists’ orbit.","Jan 31, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Village Voice,90,Stephanie Zacharek,"In the early minutes you might not be sure what you're watching. Tangerine's a comedy, of course, laced with rambunctious, exuberantly ragged dialogue. But by the end, Baker and his actors have led us to a place beyond comedy — you may still be laughing, but your breath catches a little on the way out.","Jul 7, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,New York Post,88,Sara Stewart,"The two working girls at the center of Tangerine are played by engaging newcomers: Kitana Kiki Rodriguez as the freshly out-of-jail Sin-Dee Rella, and Mya Taylor as her best friend Alexandra.","Jul 8, 2015"

TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Philadelphia Inquirer,88,Steven Rea,"Baker gets great, sly, unforced performances from his two leads, but it's not all a rollicking good time: There are moments of quietude, inquietude, moments when a sense of wariness and loneliness settles over the women.","Jul 24, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,The A.V. Club,83,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,"It’s the movie’s quietest, softest moments that register most strongly, be it Alexandra’s low-key performance of Victor Herbert’s “Toyland” to an almost empty bar, or the final scene, which finds her and Sin-Dee alone in a Laundromat at the end of a long, bad night.","Jul 8, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Portland Oregonian,83,Marc Mohan,"Baker's previous films ""Take Out"" and ""Starlet"" have focused on populations generally treated with disdain by mainstream society -- illegal immigrants and porn performers, respectively.

TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Wall Street Journal,80,Joe Morgenstern,The film is clearly not for everyone; sometimes it wasn’t for me. But it’s steadfastly nonjudgmental and wonderfully tender toward two searchers for new versions of old-fashioned love.,"Jul 9, 2015"

TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,CineVue,80,Patrick Gamble,"Poetic realism for a digital age, Tangerine also shares a lot of qualities with the cinema of Mike Leigh and Ken Loach. There's no cheap manipulation here and Baker's characters never come across as victims.","Nov 15, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Austin Chronicle,78,Steve Davis,"Tangerine’s greatest accomplishment, however, lies with director Baker, who filmed the movie using an iPhone 5S. It’s an amazing achievement – the fluidity of the camerawork is exhilarating at times, the intimacy of the close-ups sometimes unsettling.","Jul 22, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Slant Magazine,75,Ed Gonzalez,"Its triumph is primarily a matter of style, a visionary revelation every bit as expressionistic as its main character's electric sense of shade.","Jun 28, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Movie Nation,75,Roger Moore,"A feisty, funny, down-and-dirty farce as nasty as a Supreme Court dissent, as timely as a Jenner magazine cover.","Jul 7, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,TheWrap,75,Inkoo Kang,"The film bustles along through a series of reveals – a storytelling technique that can lose an audience’s sympathy or suspension of disbelief pretty fast, but which works flawlessly here because the filmmakers and the performers know exactly who their characters are and what kind of world they live in.","Jul 9, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,RogerEbert.com,75,Matt Zoller Seitz,"As written by Sean Baker and Chris Bergoch and directed by Baker, it's assured and immensely likable, and truly independent in story and style.","Jul 10, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,Washington Post,75,Ann Hornaday,"As one character observes in Tangerine, Los Angeles is “a beautifully wrapped lie.” Baker has created a fitting homage to artifice and the often tawdry, tender realities that lie beneath.","Jul 16, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,St. Louis Post-Dispatch,75,Calvin Wilson,"Although the story of Sin-Dee and Alexandra might have benefited from a bit more structure, it’s a window into a world of which many people are unaware — but a world that has its share of dreamers.","Aug 6, 2015"
TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,The New Yorker,70,Richard Brody,"Baker revels in the power of clichés and the generic energy of his low-fi cinematography, which is done with a cell phone. The results are picturesque and anecdotal.","Jul 7, 2015"

TANGERINE,2015,Sean Baker,New York Daily News,60,Jordan Hoffman,"Tangerine offers a warts-and-all depiction of a subculture seldom treated with respect by straight society. The movie handles it in a sincere way that’s entertaining, too.","Jul 9, 2015"

TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Time Out,100,Keith Uhlich,"Nichols has said that the idea for the film emerged from a free-floating anxiety that he sensed in the world at large, the feeling that everything we treasure in life could be lost in an instant.

TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Tampa Bay Times,100,Steve Persall,"Shannon is perfectly cast, a creepily magnetic actor with an otherworldly calm, tight jaw and piercing, set-apart eyes.

TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Village Voice,90,Melissa Anderson,"Despite a few missteps, Take Shelter powerfully lays bare our national anxiety disorder - a pervasive dread that Curtis can define only as ""something that's not right.""","Sep 27, 2011"
TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Wall Street Journal,90,Joe Morgenstern,"A dazzling piece of filmmaking, and much of the dazzle - as well as the anguished darkness - comes from Adam Stone's cinematography, which expresses the swirling state of Curtis's mind with richly varied flavors of light.","Sep 29, 2011"
TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Salon,90,Andrew O'Hehir,"A terrifically crafted little movie that bounces off current events and the nation's downbeat mood ingeniously, and that it variously suggests comparisons with the early work of Terrence Malick, Stanley Kubrick and the Coen brothers. Yeah, I think it's that good, but please note that I also said ""little.""","Sep 29, 2011"
TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Chicago Reader,90,J.R.

TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,The A.V. Club,83,Noel Murray,"Writer-director Jeff Nichols re-teams with his ""Shotgun Stories"" star Michael Shannon for his second feature, Take Shelter, which has a similar setting, but a different mood. Nichols is still concerned with family legacies, and the ways people in smaller communities relate to each other, but Take Shelter is slower and smoother, deliberately developing a mood of creeping dread.","Sep 28, 2011"
TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Variety,80,Justin Chang,"This deliberately paced psychological drama builds an ever-tightening knot of tension around an excellent Michael Shannon, here playing a family man slowly driven mad by apocalyptic visions that could be paranoid, prophetic or both.","Sep 25, 2011"
TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Los Angeles Times,80,Sheri Linden,"From the first moments of the eerie storm that opens the story, dread is the prevailing mood of this pre-apocalyptic drama - a film very much about this moment in time.","Sep 29, 2011"

TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,Austin Chronicle,78,Marjorie Baumgarten,"Take Shelter is a deeply unsettling movie.

TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,New York Post,63,Lou Lumenick,It would be possible to appreciate Shannon's fabulous work in Take Shelter far better if the filmmaker lost a quarter of the two-hour running time -- there are many overlong scenes that make this a needlessly tough sit.,"Sep 30, 2011"
TAKE SHELTER,2011,Jeff Nichols,San Francisco Chronicle,50,Mick LaSalle,"Take Shelter has a problem, the simplest of all problems but no less serious for its being simple. It's a film without suspense and with a slow-moving story that unfolds without surprise or embellishment.","Oct 6, 2011"

UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,2024,Matthew Rankin,Rolling Stone,100,David Fear,"There is no single category that you can slot Rankin’s mix of a wink, a nudge and an embrace into, so we guess “lo-fi masterpiece” will have to do until a better option comes along.","Feb 14, 2025"

UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,2024,Matthew Rankin,Collider,90,Jason Gorber,"The story navigates the fine line between community pride and nationalistic zeal, providing lessons for a future while admitting to the existential futility of it all.

UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,2024,Matthew Rankin,The New York Times,90,Alissa Wilkinson,"It’s a pensive meditation in an era of displacement, even if the film never tries to make a big point.

UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,2024,Matthew Rankin,The Associated Press,88,Jake Coyle,"Rankin’s film, his second following the also surreal “Twentieth Century” (2019), is propelled less by narrative thrust than the abiding oddity of its basic construction, and the movie’s slavish devotion to seeing it through without a wink.","Feb 18, 2025"

UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,2024,Matthew Rankin,The A.V. Club,83,Jacob Oller,"To further dig into Rankin’s blending of the goofily left-field and the openly earnest, the message persisting through the dry punchlines is that to care for your neighbor, to care for all the oddities of home, is to care for yourself.","Feb 12, 2025"
UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE,2024,Matthew Rankin,Variety,80,Peter Debruge,"Rankin may have conceived Universal Language in the spirit of homage, but there’s something undeniably original about the end result.

EO,2022,Jerzy Skolimowski,Los Angeles Times,100,Justin Chang,"In EO, the camera doesn’t just follow the story or record the action. Its restless, exploratory movements express a kind of shared consciousness, a spirit of communion among different members of the animal world, whether they’re running together in a field or sharing the same tight enclosure. It’s the grace of this movie to extend that communion to the human beings who pass in front of the camera, and whose fates are tightly bound up with EO’s, whether they realize it or not.","Dec 7, 2022"

EO,2022,Jerzy Skolimowski,Original-Cin,91,Liam Lacey,"What draws us in is the inventive and luminous cinematography from Michal Dymek (with additional footage by Pawel Edelman and Michal Englert), using drone shots, fish-eye lenses and red and blue filters.

Those qualities are not necessarily all concentrated in Judy Greer, either. Even if the film moves in circles, at least it’s circling something honest and true about spirituality and society alike.","Jun 12, 2023"
ERIC LARUE,2025,Michael Shannon,Collider,50,Taylor Gates,"There are several interesting ideas and stories floating around Eric LaRue, but Shannon can’t seem to decide which ones to focus on.

THE FOUNTAIN,2006,Darren Aronofsky,Rolling Stone,63,Peter Travers,"In telling a tale of love across time, Aronofsky is sometimes guilty of creating arty, pretentious psychobabble. But in visual terms, he's trying to expose his own raw, romantic heart. Folly? Maybe. But a risk worth taking.",
THE FOUNTAIN,2006,Darren Aronofsky,Chicago Tribune,63,Michael Wilmington,"It's possible to admire or respect a movie without enjoying it too much, and that's partly the reaction I had to Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain.

THE FOUNTAIN,2006,Darren Aronofsky,Miami Herald,50,Rene Rodriguez,"The Fountain is probably too muddled and half-baked to even attain cult status -- but you can still see what writer-director Darren Aronofsky was striving for, and even if his reach exceeded his grasp, his intentions were both admirable and worthy of respect.",

CAT PEOPLE,1982,Paul Schrader,Newsweek,100,Jack Kroll,"Cat People retains the psychological suggestiveness of the original while adding a blazing, carefully controlled eroticism and violence as well as state-of-the-art special effects and a ravishing over-all physical design. And it has the quintessential cat-person in Nastassia Kinski. As with all horror classics, what might be ludicrous is transformed into something gripping by the passionate logic of a grotesque metaphor. Alan Ormsby's screenplay has the logic and Paul Schrader has the passion. The result is Schrader's best work as a director. [05 Apr 1982, p.74]",
CAT PEOPLE,1982,Paul Schrader,Washington Post,90,Rita Kempley,"The throbbing, urgent score by Giorgio Moroder, the cat jokes and the stylish look make Cat People a purrfectly good Meow Mix. [02 Apr 1982, p.11]",
CAT PEOPLE,1982,Paul Schrader,Chicago Sun-Times,88,Roger Ebert,"Cat People moves back and forth between its mythic and realistic levels, held together primarily by the strength of Kinski's performance and John Heard's obsession. Kinski is something. She never overacts in this movie, never steps wrong, never seems ridiculous; she just steps onscreen and convincingly underplays a leopard. Heard also is good.",
CAT PEOPLE,1982,Paul Schrader,Variety,80,Staff (Not Credited),"Paul Schrader’s reworking of the 1942 Val Lewton-Jacques Tourneur Cat People is a super-chic erotic horror story of mixed impact. Kinski was essential to the film as conceived, and she’s endlessly watchable.",
CAT PEOPLE,1982,Paul Schrader,Slant Magazine,75,Chuck Bowen,"The opening credits immediately insist that director Paul Schrader isn’t interested in merely reprising your grandparents’ beloved version of Cat People, the 1942 horror film memorably directed by Jacques Tourneur and produced by Val Lewton. Set to the background of a profoundly bright brick red, which is soon revealed to be a desert jungle-scape, Giorgio Moroder’s primal synth score prepares us for an erotic blowout that overtly literalizes the Cat People conceit for the sake of a little soft porn fun.",
CAT PEOPLE,1982,Paul Schrader,Slant Magazine,75,Ed Gonzalez,"Unjustifiably compared to the original film upon its release, Schrader’s Cat People is more of an erotic reinvention of the Bodeen story. Though Schrader keeps the Fangoria crowd at bay with a series of grisly tableaus, he remains less concerned with the body-horrific than he does with the rituals of sex—mandatory and otherwise.",
CAT PEOPLE,1982,Paul Schrader,The Dissolve,70,Nathan Rabin,"While Cat People feels like an early Bruckheimer production, it’s also permeated with the themes that personify Schrader’s work as a screenwriter and filmmaker: obsession, sex, the strange permutations of destiny, and man’s bottomless capacity for cruelty and violence.",
CAT PEOPLE,1982,Paul Schrader,The Globe and Mail (Toronto),63,Jay Scott,"Cat People, a remake by the not noticeably gifted director Paul Schrader, of a 1942 RKO mood piece about a lady who thought herself capable of turning into a panther, is many things, not every one of them bad: as a B-movie, this fantasy of a young woman who develops the distressing habit of changing shape after sex is moderately entertaining.

CAT PEOPLE,1982,Paul Schrader,Empire,60,Kim Newman,"It's not exactly good, and it has some very bad scenes indeed, but the performances sometimes sparkle and the unusual happy ending -- scored with David Bowie's 'Putting Out the Fire With Gasoline' -- is surprisingly moving.",
CAT PEOPLE,1982,Paul Schrader,TV Guide Magazine,50,,"Director Paul Schrader's dreamlike, stylishly atmospheric remake of Val Lewton's 1942 horror classic needs to be taken on its own terms: viewers who assent to its Freudian logic and creepy sexuality will likely be entranced, but just a little critical distance renders the whole thing irretrievably ludicrous.",

LIGHT SLEEPER,1992,Paul Schrader,Empire,80,Kim Newman,This doesn't have the high style that made Taxi Driver or American Gigolo instant cultural icons - although Schrader shows more than a few traces of Scorsese as his camera creeps- perhaps because it's concerned with a chilly 90s that looks back with a sort of nostalgia on the cocaine-fuelled craziness of earlier years. But it does develop powerfully the themes of Schrader's earlier work and will not disappoint his fans.,
LIGHT SLEEPER,1992,Paul Schrader,Rolling Stone,75,Peter Travers,"Schrader is out there again, testing the limits of audience tolerance. Good for him. Buoyed by his questing spirit and Dafoe's mesmerizing performance, Light Sleeper might just keep you up nights.",

LIGHT SLEEPER,1992,Paul Schrader,The Seattle Times,75,Jeff Shannon,"Schrader's dialogue ranks among his best, and Sarandon chews up her delightful role with infectious, boldly confrontational relish.

LIGHT SLEEPER,1992,Paul Schrader,Chicago Tribune,75,Gene Siskel,"A problem with Schrader's script is that he too slavishly follows the Taxi Driver outline, needlessly giving a violent conclusion to Light Sleeper. We sit there noting the resemblance to the 1975 movie more than being absorbed into the drama. Nonetheless, Light Sleeper is emblematic of an era, and is recommended on that basis and on the excellent quality of it acting. We remember the character more than we believe the machinations they've run through.",
LIGHT SLEEPER,1992,Paul Schrader,St. Louis Post-Dispatch,75,Joe Pollack,"In the end, Light Sleeper is slightly more optimistic than some of Schrader's earlier works, but it's a tough, hard-nosed film that shows, in small moments here and there, what life in drugs is all about - and it ain't all about fun.

It uses the Eisenhower era — the characters, costumes, gestures and particularly, the music—to create a time and place that have less to do with any real 50's than with a kind of show business that is both timeless and old-fashioned, both sentimental and wise.

In place of incident, character and a bemused view of small-town life, corrupt beneath its cherry-pie surface, we are essentially asked to witness torture - mostly of Laura Palmer, as her troubles lead her to self-destruct with drugs and promiscuity, including a couple of side trips to the Canadian bordello known as One-Eyed Jacks. For all the violence in Lynch's ""Blue Velvet,"" that film maintained a comic dimension. The violence in ""Wild at Heart,"" for all its extravagance of gesture, was hollow - stylized, not real...Here, there's no comedy, nothing surreal, just wave after wave of titillation. Except that it doesn't titillate. It depresses. There's no psychic charge on any of it. It proceeds from no artistic conviction, just from a cynical desire to squeeze a few more bucks from the already overworked corpse of Laura Palmer. It shows how quickly a creative impulse can be exhausted - from quirky originality toying with humanity's darker impulses to dispirited quasi-porn. [29 Aug 1992, p.23]",

Though its Midwestern locale and lower socioeconomic stratum give it a different setting, River's Edge shares something with Bret Easton Ellis's Less Than Zero, a novel that is also full of directionless, drug-taking teen-age characters who are without moral moorings and left entirely to their own devices. This is as chilling to witness as it is difficult to dramatize, if only because at their centers these lives are already so empty.",

RIVER'S EDGE,1986,Tim Hunter,Washington Post,50,Hal Hinson,"At its worst, River's Edge is crackpot sociology. Jimenez and Hunter use the characters' lack of affect as an indictment.

RIVER'S EDGE,1986,Tim Hunter,Time Out London,50,,"For all its uncompromising toughness, the film, like the kids, gets out of hand, its bleak portrait of alienated, antisocial behaviour increasingly wrecked by hysterical performances (Glover especially), a sentimental teen-romance subplot, and melodramatic contrivance. There are some good, frightening scenes of volatile lunacy, but the whole thing badly lacks a controlling distance and perspective; much inferior to Hunter's script for Jonathan Kaplan's superficially similar Over the Edge, it continually teeters on the verge of self-parody.",

Babygirl,2024,Halina Reijn,The Film Verdict,95,Alonso Duralde,"Babygirl is the rare adult drama that understands that complicated characters can be likable, even if their behavior is sometimes decidedly unlikable; it addresses power and gender dynamics in ways that avoid easy, post-#metoo buzzwords; and it’s going to lead to some really interesting post-screening date-night discussions.","Aug 30, 2024"
Babygirl,2024,Halina Reijn,The Playlist,91,Rafaela Sales Ross,"This back and forth between assuredness and doubt also makes “Babygirl” a refreshing look at BDSM and questions of consent and desire. Reijn is unafraid to have her characters play out all the wobbles that come with negotiating one another’s boundaries, reinforcing how pleasure comes from good communication. That the Dutch director manages to do so while crafting some of the hottest sex scenes in a major film in years and without dropping the ball in pacing this satire on the era of the politically correct feels almost impossible.","Aug 30, 2024"
Babygirl,2024,Halina Reijn,The Film Stage,91,Savina Petkova,"There is wit, some stinging humor, and a lot of arousal baked into Babygirl, but it all works so well as an exciting, sexy (yes, let’s reclaim this word!) whole because the film pays attention to sex. The mood, the boundaries, the mistakes, the ecstasy of it all feed into its melodramatic streaks.","Aug 30, 2024"
Babygirl,2024,Halina Reijn,Screen Rant,90,Alexander Harrison,"Truly, all of Babygirl is fascinating to watch. There's such clear perspective in the filmmaking, and even though I've dwelt on Reijn's more thoughtful touches, the defining trait for many might be a wicked sense of humor. Laughter came easy and often for me and the audience I saw it with – sometimes with the characters, sometimes at them, but always with the movie. It's as if we're being reminded that, however serious the themes, this is supposed to be fun. And it is. But be prepared to find yourself grappling with a whole lot more.","Aug 30, 2024"
Babygirl,2024,Halina Reijn,Variety,90,Owen Gleiberman,"Babygirl takes a few turns we don’t expect, but that’s because the movie’s ambition isn’t just to feed the thriller engine. It’s to capture something genuine about women’s erotic experience in the age of control.","Aug 30, 2024"

Babygirl,2024,Halina Reijn,Los Angeles Times,90,Amy Nicholson,"Babygirl’s erotic scenes are hot. But really, Reijn is doing her damnedest to get a moral rise out of us.

Babygirl,2024,Halina Reijn,Rolling Stone,90,David Fear,"It’s not just that Kidman shows you this woman’s sexual fulfillment — it’s the way she gives you everything happening around it, in the most intimate and telling of ways.

Ultimately, though, Babygirl comes to seem genuinely romantic, because Romy and Samuel are fumbling their way towards a deeper understanding of each other. As uncomfortable as the film may be, it's clear that Reijn loves and respects her damaged characters, even if they're not sure of how they feel about themselves.","Aug 30, 2024"

In a plague-ridden town, it’s Ellen’s visionary, full-tilt fever that allows her to more closely commune with the evil around her, maybe even finding a hint of sick ecstasy.

Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,The Observer (UK),80,Wendy Ide,"There’s something about the macabre sensuality and mossy, crepuscular gloom of this retelling of the vampire legend that leaves a mark on the audience. It’s not so much a viewing experience as a kind of haunting.","Dec 30, 2024"
Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,i,80,Christina Newland,"Obsessed by rooting his supernatural folk tales in the realities of historical life, Eggers turns Nosferatu into a gothic horror fairy-tale. It’s retro in the best sense of the word.","Jan 3, 2025"
Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,The A.V. Club,75,Katie Rife,"There are moments of genuine horror and genuine artfulness in Nosferatu, neither of which would have been possible if the writer-director had approached the project with tongue in cheek. But at two hours and 12 minutes, it’s a solemn death march towards an inevitable conclusion—which fits the theme, but strains the limits of audience engagement.","Dec 2, 2024"
Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,Consequence,75,Liz Shannon Miller,"Nosferatu delivers exactly what it promised — a new version of a classic tale, told by one of our most technically accomplished filmmakers. And this is certainly a more explicitly sexy version of Nosferatu than what the original German film delivered 102 years ago. However, it otherwise follows its source material, as well as the paths laid out by other adaptations, so faithfully that its most original elements feel drowned out by the familiar. It’s perhaps the best-made Dracula adaptation to come around in a long time. But it never feels essential.","Dec 2, 2024"
Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,LarsenOnFilm,75,Josh Larsen,"Nosferatu feels unique compared to other Dracula variations in the way this world appears drained—of color, light, nearly life itself. It’s as if blood has been sucked from the very images.","Dec 6, 2024"
Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,San Francisco Chronicle,75,G. Allen Johnson,"If you know the Dracula legend, you know what comes next. “Nosferatu,” which also was remade by Werner Herzog in 1979, is therefore somewhat predictable. But the images and performances are so riveting that it doesn't matter.","Dec 18, 2024"
Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,Washington Post,75,Ty Burr,"“Nosferatu” haunts as you watch it and vanishes when the lights come up, leaving a viewer shaken but not stirred. Still: Fangs for the memories.","Dec 24, 2024"
Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,USA Today,75,Brian Truitt,"Visually sumptuous and surprisingly sensual, ""Nosferatu"" isn’t as wonderfully original (or bonkers) as Eggers' top-notch flicks “The Witch” and “The Northman,” but great turns from Lily-Rose Depp and Bill Skarsgård sell its disturbing, otherworldly beauty-and-the-beast tale.","Dec 24, 2024"
Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,The Atlantic,75,David Sims,"The director’s meticulousness overtakes some scenes, crowding out any real sense of dread; occasionally his characters seemed to be drowning in the gorgeous, complex sets they were moving through. Eggers always manages to freak me out, though, despite the occasional lapses into tedium—he knows just how to evoke the simple fear of the unknown.","Dec 25, 2024"
Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,Movie Nation,75,Roger Moore,"Eggers indulges himself in all the tricks of the scary cinema’s trade — simple historic ffects given a digital boost in recreating an 1830s Europe of gloom, greys and shades of brown and red. The most chilling image is of the shadow of count’s clawed hand, stretching across a sleeping city, reaching for Ellen.","Dec 27, 2024"
Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,The Seattle Times,75,Soren Andersen,"It’s not the best Dracula movie of all time, though it aspires to that. Murnau’s original still leads the pack. But it certainly is the most stylish. Eggers is a filmmaker with astonishing visual flair.","Dec 28, 2024"
Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,The Film Verdict,71,Alonso Duralde,"Nosferatu offers all the atmospherics and the creeping dread that it should, but this version remains locked-in and static when it might have dared to explore new ground. Like its antagonist, it’s simultaneously living and dead.","Dec 5, 2024"
Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,The Irish Times,70,Tara Brady,"The first half of the film is spellbinding; Eggers and his cinematographer, Jarin Blaschke, brilliantly redeploy the grammar of German expressionism to make Dracula (or thereabouts) scary again.","Jan 2, 2025"
Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,We Got This Covered,70,Marco Vito Oddo,"Robert Eggers' reimagining of the 1922 classic ""Nosferatu"" delivers a visually striking but uneven Gothic horror experience, elevated by Lily-Rose Depp's captivating performance and stunning second half.","Jan 2, 2025"
Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,Polygon,68,Oli Welsh,"Eggers has made a visually grand movie, with an impressively doomy atmosphere and one hell of a closing shot. As a finely wrought monument to the ultimate Gothic horror movie, it’s worth seeing. But as a new reading of one of the most resonant stories of the past 150 years, it rings hollow.","Jan 15, 2025"
Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,The Associated Press,63,Jocelyn Noveck,"Bring your hand warmers, toe warmers, heart warmers and soul warmers — this update of the 1922 silent vampire classic will chill you to the bone...But it may not terrify you. Everything in Robert Eggers’ faithful, even adoring remake, from his picturesque 19th century German town to those bleak mountain snowscapes leading to that (brrr) imposing castle in Transylvania, looks great. But with its stylized, often stilted dialogue and overly dramatic storytelling, it feels more like everyone is living in a quaint period painting rather than a world populated by real humans (and, well, vampires) made of flesh and, er, blood.","Dec 24, 2024"
Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,The Guardian,60,Peter Bradshaw,"It is an interesting new Nosferatu for our age of pandemic fear, with some beautiful images and striking moments, particularly in the eerie moonlit hallucination sequence at the beginning, which makes the rest of the story feel slightly literal and self-conscious.","Dec 2, 2024"
Nosferatu,2024,Robert Eggers,The Telegraph,60,Tim Robey,"While Bill Skarsgård only fitfully impresses as Count Orlok in Robert Eggers’s chilling remake, Lily-Rose Depp proves she’s one to watch.","Dec 2, 2024"
The Seed of the Sacred Fig,2024,Mohammad Rasoulof,Time Out,100,Phil de Semlyen,"It clocks in at three hours but not a scene feels superfluous as its central quartet – dad, mum, two teenage daughters – squabble, fall out and finally implode in a subversive final act.","May 28, 2024"
The Seed of the Sacred Fig,2024,Mohammad Rasoulof,The Telegraph,100,Robbie Collin,"The film itself is a mesmerisingly gripping and controlled parable-thriller in which the paranoia, misogyny and rage of the Iranian state are mapped seamlessly onto an ordinary family unit.","May 28, 2024"
The Seed of the Sacred Fig,2024,Mohammad Rasoulof,IndieWire,91,Ryan Lattanzio,Rasoulof crafts an extraordinarily gripping allegory about the corrupting costs of power and the suppression of women under a religious patriarchy that crushes the very people it claims to protect.,"May 25, 2024"
The Seed of the Sacred Fig,2024,Mohammad Rasoulof,The Playlist,91,Gregory Ellwood,"A victim of a politically motivated jail sentence for supporting the 2022 Masha Amini hijab protests, Rasoulof‘s latest feature will likely anger the Iranian government even more. Especially considering how brilliant “Sacred Fig” is at deconstructing the rampant injustice in the totalitarian state.","May 28, 2024"
The Seed of the Sacred Fig,2024,Mohammad Rasoulof,The A.V. Club,91,Matt Schimkowitz,"Eschewing the formal flare of his previous work, Rasoulof finds something more immediate here, a drama that burns like a political thriller and sears like a documentary.","Nov 27, 2024"
The Seed of the Sacred Fig,2024,Mohammad Rasoulof,Collider,90,Chase Hutchinson,"It's a remarkable, revolutionary work of art. As precisely focused and tightly constructed as it is expansive in its aspirations, it’s a rallying cry for the irreplaceable value of artistic expression in a world that will repress it at all costs.","May 25, 2024"
The Seed of the Sacred Fig,2024,Mohammad Rasoulof,The Hollywood Reporter,90,Jordan Mintzer,"As Rasoulof intercuts real footage and fiction, we realize that what the family is going through is an extension of what the entire country has been facing.","May 25, 2024"
The Seed of the Sacred Fig,2024,Mohammad Rasoulof,Variety,90,Peter Debruge,"The situation Rasoulof depicts is hardly limited to Iran. There are echoes of Nazi Germany and modern-day China in the way average citizens submit, while the pressures to inform on one’s neighbors recall pre-perestroika Soviet policies. Rasoulof’s genius comes in focusing on how this dynamic plays out within a family, which makes it personal.","May 25, 2024"

The Seed of the Sacred Fig,2024,Mohammad Rasoulof,The New Yorker,90,Justin Chang,"Beneath Rasoulof’s blistering rage erupts a wellspring of empathy: for young women, like Rezvan and Sana, fighting to be heard, and for wives and mothers, like Najmeh, participating in their own oppression.","Nov 26, 2024"
The Seed of the Sacred Fig,2024,Mohammad Rasoulof,The New York Times,90,Alissa Wilkinson,"The Seed of the Sacred Fig asks us to enter a family’s story, but also to acknowledge that we are part of it. We’re extras in the background, no matter how far away we are. For Rasoulof, the world he’s created is far from theoretical. The consequences have been, too.","Nov 27, 2024"
The Seed of the Sacred Fig,2024,Mohammad Rasoulof,The Daily Beast,90,Nick Schager,"Rasoulof’s film damns Iran for its fanatical, corrupting, chauvinistic tyranny, all while generating breakneck suspense and, ultimately, resolving its tale with a disaster that contains within it a measure of hopefulness.","Nov 27, 2024"
The Seed of the Sacred Fig,2024,Mohammad Rasoulof,New York Magazine (Vulture),90,Roxana Hadadi,"Thanks partially to actual protest footage filmed by Woman, Life, Freedom participants, there’s a thoroughness to the way the film presents the perspectives of the young women living in the country.","Nov 27, 2024"
The Seed of the Sacred Fig,2024,Mohammad Rasoulof,The Globe and Mail (Toronto),90,Noel Ransome,It plays out like that rare piece of art capable of capturing the individual agency inherent in both resistance and compliance. An entire history of oppression isn’t needed here – that is beyond the scope of any one film and a waste of this one.,"Jan 10, 2025"
The Seed of the Sacred Fig,2024,Mohammad Rasoulof,RogerEbert.com,88,Godfrey Cheshire,"Rasoulof gets terrific performances from all of his cast, but particularly noteworthy is Sohelia Golestani's work as Najmeh, which captures the woman's subtle, gradual transition from defender of her husband to an ally of her daughters.","Nov 27, 2024"
The Seed of the Sacred Fig,2024,Mohammad Rasoulof,Washington Post,88,Ty Burr,"At times heavy-handed in its symbolism, “Seed” is still a gripping, provocative knockout — a domestic political thriller — that hints at the limits of oppression and the long, long bending of Martin Luther King Jr.’s “moral arc.”","Jan 2, 2025"
The Seed of the Sacred Fig,2024,Mohammad Rasoulof,The Film Stage,83,David Katz,"What we have is a domestic thriller initially consigned to the domicile before the impact of its primary, female characters shatter those confines, taking it to the desert-like ex-urban outskirts and the hypothetical beyond.","Aug 30, 2024"

The Seed of the Sacred Fig,2024,Mohammad Rasoulof,Wall Street Journal,80,Kyle Smith,"Through a single family, Mr. Rasoulof has created a vivid portrait of the dilemmas of today’s Iran, where the power of iman, or faith, suggests one kind of observation but the power of the iPhone suggests another.","Nov 27, 2024"

The Seed of the Sacred Fig,2024,Mohammad Rasoulof,The Irish Times,80,Donald Clarke,"More than a few critics have suggested the film ends up losing the run of itself, but few would deny that it remains indecently entertaining up to the last frame. Odd, special, important.","Feb 6, 2025"
The Seed of the Sacred Fig,2024,Mohammad Rasoulof,The Observer (UK),80,Wendy Ide,The Seed of the Sacred Fig may not be his most elegant picture – it has pacing issues and a laboured final act – but it is without doubt Rasoulof’s most important film to date.,"Feb 10, 2025"
The Seed of the Sacred Fig,2024,Mohammad Rasoulof,The Atlantic,78,Shirley Li,"The film is, as a result, a portrait of how Rasoulof perceives the systematic oppression within his home country, from which he is now exiled. The government’s rejection of its citizens’ efforts for change is personal to him—as devastating and painful, the film suggests, as having a father turn against his own flesh and blood.","Dec 12, 2024"
The Seed of the Sacred Fig,2024,Mohammad Rasoulof,The Film Verdict,70,Deborah Young,"Building slowly, the story morphs into a thriller, and finally a sort of horror film, though these parts feel more like decent imitations than real genre work.","May 25, 2024"
The Seed of the Sacred Fig,2024,Mohammad Rasoulof,Screen Daily,70,Jonathan Romney,"The film is uneven: gripping when it maps out psychological stresses in a claustrophobic domestic setting, less so in the final stretches when it incongruously morphs into a women-in-peril thriller.","May 25, 2024"

Saltburn,2023,Emerald Fennell,Entertainment Weekly,100,Maureen Lee Lenker,"The film is not for the faint of heart, but it is viscerally compelling and unafraid to luxuriate in its own elegant weirdness.

Saltburn,2023,Emerald Fennell,The Telegraph,100,Robbie Collin,"Fennell has a sharp eye for outrage, and an even sharper one for hotness, crafting any number of scenarios and images here that may elicit sotto voce phwoars against your better judgement.","Nov 16, 2023"
Saltburn,2023,Emerald Fennell,Observer,100,Rex Reed,"Gorgeously photographed by Linus Sandgren, it’s both beautifully directed and cleverly written by British Oscar-winner Emerald Fennell, who follows her highly regarded Promising Young Woman with a film of even more staggering impact.","Dec 18, 2023"

Saltburn,2023,Emerald Fennell,TheWrap,80,Tomris Laffly,"In the end, Saltburn works as a distinct and wildly entertaining probe into familiar waters of privilege, rather than the definite word on it, one that reinforces Fennell as a distinguished auteur of the big and the bold even on shaky grounds.","Sep 2, 2023"
Saltburn,2023,Emerald Fennell,BBC,80,Nicholas Barber,"If you see it as a lurid pulp fantasy rather than a penetrating satire, then Saltburn is deliriously enjoyable. It's the dialogue and the performances that clinch it.","Oct 6, 2023"
Saltburn,2023,Emerald Fennell,IGN,80,Martin Carr,"Aside from a few pacing issues, Saltburn delivers an uncompromising vision from Emerald Fennell, an Oscar-winning writer director with a unique voice.

Saltburn,2023,Emerald Fennell,Time Out,80,Phil de Semlyen,"Fennell has captured something real about these unreal people and the world they live in. Her film slices with a scalpel, peels back the layers and finds only hollowness beneath. Maybe that’s the real twist.","Nov 8, 2023"

Saltburn,2023,Emerald Fennell,Screen Daily,70,Fionnuala Halligan,"Fennell is in that kind of blow-it-all-up mode, and the result is a spikily entertaining, narratively rackety ride led by a formidable Barry Keoghan in devil-may-care mode.","Sep 2, 2023"
Saltburn,2023,Emerald Fennell,Vanity Fair,70,Richard Lawson,"Stylish and intriguing, Saltburn proves an engaging sit for the majority of its run, and thus a stumble—even a big one—can mostly be forgiven.

La Chimera,2023,Alice Rohrwacher,The Associated Press,100,Jake Coyle,"When we talk about “movie magic,” the first thing that comes to mind is often something like the bikes achieving liftoff in “E.T.” But it applies no less to Alice Rohrwacher’s wondrous “La Chimera,” a grubbily transcendent folk tale of a film that finds its enchantment buried in the ground.","Mar 27, 2024"

La Chimera,2023,Alice Rohrwacher,Los Angeles Times,100,Carlos Aguilar,"As with Rohrwacher’s previous movies, there is an exquisite blurring between the tangible and the ethereal, the urban and the pastoral, life and death, past and present — all of it overlapping with the same ease as the hues of a twilight sky.","Mar 29, 2024"

La Chimera,2023,Alice Rohrwacher,RogerEbert.com,75,Christy Lemire,"After deftly navigating a variety of tones, Rorhwacher places O’Connor’s Arthur at the center of a moment that’s truly surprising, and surprisingly poignant.

Bird,2024,Andrea Arnold,Vanity Fair,70,Richard Lawson,"Bird is a puzzling film, but gradually draws us toward a significant catharsis.","May 18, 2024"
Bird,2024,Andrea Arnold,The New York Times,70,Alissa Wilkinson,"There’s a wealth of lovely performances in Bird, including Adams, who holds the film together by slowly taking on tenderness as it progresses. But the two poles of the movie are Rogowski and Keoghan, who radiate precisely opposite energies.","Nov 7, 2024"
Bird,2024,Andrea Arnold,The Globe and Mail (Toronto),70,Saffron Maeve,"Perhaps Bird is best understood as a film about self-consciousness or perhaps it is just a self-conscious film, ironing out the flaws of these well-meaning characters to create a fairy tale or apologue.","Nov 7, 2024"
Bird,2024,Andrea Arnold,New York Magazine (Vulture),70,Alison Willmore,"Bird is the newest feature from Andrea Arnold — her first scripted film since the 2016 U.S. road odyssey American Honey — and it serves up an endearing, ungainly mix of the gritty and the magical.","Nov 8, 2024"

Bird,2024,Andrea Arnold,The Guardian,60,Peter Bradshaw,"It meditates on identity and belonging, the poignancy of not being valued, not being seen, the transition from childhood to adulthood, girlhood to womanhood, sexism and cruelty. The energy and heartfelt good humour offset the moments of cliche and implausibility.","May 18, 2024"
Bird,2024,Andrea Arnold,The Telegraph,60,Tim Robey,"Personally, I couldn’t follow Arnold over the dotted line into violent magical realism, however situated it might be in a young girl’s sense of fantasy. It’s a miscalculation, like playing your weakest suit mistaking it for a trump.","May 18, 2024"
Bird,2024,Andrea Arnold,Collider,60,Caleb Hammond,"Bird ultimately reads as Arnold “playing the hits” with a narrative she fundamentally knows how to stage in her sleep. Ultimately it feels too familiar, even with the welcome magical realism additions and a hallucinogenic slime secreting toad. Arnold fans will no doubt find plenty to latch onto with Bird, but it’s unlikely to convert non-believers.","May 18, 2024"
Bird,2024,Andrea Arnold,The Film Stage,58,Rory O'Connor,The director has gestured toward magical realism in her work before (think of the white horse in Fish Tank or the elemental yearning of her Wuthering Heights) but this first foray into anthropomorphism feels strangely surface-level and does more to break the film’s spell than enhance it.,"May 18, 2024"
Bird,2024,Andrea Arnold,Entertainment Weekly,58,Maureen Lee Lenker,"Like the butterflies and pockets of natural beauty that Bailey is drawn to, there are glimmers of potential in Bird. But it never fully manages to take flight, leaving its provocative conclusion more jarring and confusing than revelatory.","Aug 31, 2024"
Bird,2024,Andrea Arnold,Variety,50,Owen Gleiberman,The film is Arnold trying to have the integrity of her severity and eat it too. Bird is a feel-bad movie that turns into a feel-good movie. What it never feels like is a totally authentic movie.,"May 18, 2024"
Bird,2024,Andrea Arnold,Screen Rant,50,Patrice Witherspoon,"A harrowing narrative that contemplates the transition from girlhood to womanhood, Arnold uses magical realism to capture preteen angst with a strong desire for existential freedom.","May 28, 2024"
Bird,2024,Andrea Arnold,Slant Magazine,50,David Robb,"As evocative as it is, the film’s use of small-town squalor as a blank canvas for artful indulgences often detracts from its purported authenticity.","Nov 5, 2024"
Bird,2024,Andrea Arnold,The Associated Press,50,Jake Coyle,"Bird may go down as a rare miss for Arnold but you can still see the keenness of her eye and the nimbleness of her camera, with her regular cinematographer Robbie Ryan. And that’s true never so much as when the camera is on Adams, a talent, whose melancholy eyes say more than all the theatrics around her.","Nov 6, 2024"

Asteroid City,2023,Wes Anderson,IndieWire,100,David Ehrlich,"If all of Anderson’s movies are sustained by the tension between order and chaos, uncertainty and doubt, “Asteroid City” is the first that takes that tension as its subject, often expressing it through the friction created by rubbing together its various levels of non-reality.","May 23, 2023"
Asteroid City,2023,Wes Anderson,The Independent,100,Geoffrey Macnab,"In its own offbeat way, Asteroid City is an Anderson patchwork of Cold War paranoia and American family values in all their often hypocritical glory.

Asteroid City,2023,Wes Anderson,Vox,100,Alissa Wilkinson,"In Asteroid City, Anderson builds several worlds mediated by layers of performance, artifice, and technology, in which nonetheless real humans grieve, long for one another, fall in love, get hurt, and feel wonder.

Asteroid City,2023,Wes Anderson,Little White Lies,100,David Jenkins,"Asteroid City is Anderson’s most complete, rich and surprising film to date, and perhaps his most autobiographical in some obscure, allegorical way, in that it stands as testament to how filmmaking is about bringing artists together and attuning them to a specific wavelength. On a more superficial level, it’s a film which pushes his patented funny/sad dichotomy to its wildest and most enjoyable extremes.","Jun 20, 2023"

Asteroid City,2023,Wes Anderson,LarsenOnFilm,88,Josh Larsen,"Asteroid City might be Anderson’s bleakest film, bordering, at times, on nihilistic. His comedies have always had a mordant edge—both The Royal Tenenbaums and The Darjeeling Limited directly address suicide and grief—yet they usually employ despair as a starting point, from which the characters move toward healing of some kind. In contrast, Asteroid City—like the rumbling reverberations of those atomic explosions—quivers with disquietude throughout.","Jun 15, 2023"

Asteroid City,2023,Wes Anderson,NME,80,James Mottram,"Anderson and co-writer Roman Coppola have great fun with the idea, channeling 1950s B-movie vibes.

Asteroid City,2023,Wes Anderson,The Guardian,80,Peter Bradshaw,"The movie rattles cleverly and exhilaratingly along, adroitly absorbing the implications of pathos and loneliness without allowing itself to slow down.

Asteroid City,2023,Wes Anderson,The Film Verdict,79,Stephen Dalton,"For Anderson fans, Asteroid City will be a pure guiltless pleasure, a full sensory immersion in his dazzling Day-Glo Pop Art toybox.

Asteroid City,2023,Wes Anderson,Austin Chronicle,78,Kimberley Jones,"Tilting surprisingly dark – I suspect the film is at least in part about how we process trauma – but also somewhat impenetrable on first watch, it was another startlement when I realized I was crying.

Asteroid City,2023,Wes Anderson,The Playlist,75,Rodrigo Perez,The minor problem of it all is while what Anderson is trying to say can be read across the sky like a beautifully glistening moonbeam; it does often lack the craterous depth of feeling we know he’s capable of when doing his best creative and emotional astrography.,"May 23, 2023"

Asteroid City,2023,Wes Anderson,Chicago Tribune,75,Michael Phillips,"Anderson keeps inventing and detailing new unrealities to explore.

Asteroid City,2023,Wes Anderson,The Seattle Times,75,Moira Macdonald,"This is Anderson soaring a bit, playing with the very nature of storytelling and performing, unafraid to let us get a little lost in the process.

Asteroid City,2023,Wes Anderson,Los Angeles Times,60,Justin Chang,"The conceit itself is by turns intriguing and laborious, and depending on your willingness to unpack it, it will be either the revelation that sends this movie soaring into the stratosphere or the heavy stone that drags its featherweight pleasures down to earth.","Jun 15, 2023"
Asteroid City,2023,Wes Anderson,Slate,60,Dana Stevens,"If Asteroid City had kept its focus more tightly on these two troubled families, it might have turned into the most emotionally truthful movie Anderson has yet made.

Happening,2021,Audrey Diwan,The New York Times,100,Manohla Dargis,"Throughout, Diwan’s gaze remains clear, direct, fearless. She shows you a part of life that the movies rarely do.

Happening,2021,Audrey Diwan,The Atlantic,94,Shirley Li,"The film can be unrelenting: Several graphic scenes make it challenging to watch, and more than once, I caught myself holding my breath.

Happening,2021,Audrey Diwan,The Globe and Mail (Toronto),91,Amil Niazi,"Happening is set in the sixties, but Diwan’s stark, unwavering direction, coupled with sparing costumes and cinematographer Laurent Tangy’s intimate lens, lend the film a sense of timelessness. The power of Happening is in the terrifying knowledge that Anne’s struggles could be happening to anyone, at any time.","May 13, 2022"
Happening,2021,Audrey Diwan,Collider,91,Ross Bonaime,"Diwan’s reflective, quiet tone only highlights the sheer dread of this situation, and shows that restriction and taboos about such issues only makes this world a more cruel and terrifying place.

Happening,2021,Audrey Diwan,Variety,90,Guy Lodge,"Happening is filmed and performed in such a delicate, skin-soft register, meanwhile, that the escalating terror of Anne’s situation is all the more pronounced, eventually pivoting into a realm of wholly realism-based body horror.","Sep 11, 2021"
Happening,2021,Audrey Diwan,Los Angeles Times,90,Justin Chang,"To call this movie timely would be both an understatement and a bit of a misnomer, since the battle for women’s bodily autonomy has never not been a timely issue.

Happening,2021,Audrey Diwan,Austin Chronicle,89,Marjorie Baumgarten,"Based on a memoir by Annie Ernaux, Happening is remarkable for its first-person depiction of the panic and desperation of a young woman carrying an unwanted pregnancy.

Happening,2021,Audrey Diwan,The Irish Times,80,Donald Clarke,"Detailing the cold shoulders offered to a young woman after she becomes pregnant in 1960s France, the film works evocative period detail in with implicit warnings against contemporary backsliding on reproductive rights.

Happening,2021,Audrey Diwan,Rolling Stone,80,David Fear,"It’s these life-or-death stakes that Happening puts front and center, as it forces viewers to not just confront the stigma associated with abortion — a word, by the way, that’s never uttered in the film — but to immerse themselves in the same dread and paranoia that Anne feels.","May 5, 2022"

They have used Mr. Bogart's personality, so well established in other brilliant films, to inject a cold point of tough resistance to evil forces afoot in Europe today.

The Banshees of Inisherin,2022,Martin McDonagh,The Playlist,91,Rodrigo Perez,"Rich, layered, and full of beautiful shapeshifting emotional depth—at times laugh-out-loud funny, and then stopping on a dime to turn melancholy, heartrending, and or horrifying—The Banshee of Insherin will surely unsettle audiences trying to pinpoint blame or ascribe a hero or villain to the piece. Its morality and personal sympathies are purposefully opaque.","Sep 5, 2022"
The Banshees of Inisherin,2022,Martin McDonagh,Collider,91,Brian Formo,"Like the sparse land of its setting, Inisherin is a film that reveals multitudes through observation and reflection. While I’m writing mostly of its emotional seriousness, it is also compassionate and humorous.","Sep 5, 2022"
The Banshees of Inisherin,2022,Martin McDonagh,Entertainment Weekly,91,Leah Greenblatt,"To be corny, which the film is decidedly not, it's about life: the brevity of it, the risks we do or don't take, who in the end we choose to share it with.

The Banshees of Inisherin,2022,Martin McDonagh,Time,90,Stephanie Zacharek,"Farrell brings extra layers of depth and mournfulness to the classic McDonagh pattern. He’s the character you want to protect, and the one who sends your heart sinking when you see him harden, out of necessity, against the world. He gives The Banshees of Inisherin its soul and its beauty. To look at his face is to understand the half-welcoming, half-unforgiving place known as home.","Sep 5, 2022"
The Banshees of Inisherin,2022,Martin McDonagh,New York Magazine (Vulture),90,Alison Willmore,"The Banshees of Inisherin is like watching two cars slowly set out on a collision course ending in a crash that would be easily averted if one would just give way. But it’s also a caustic masterstroke of anti-romanticism, a counter to every starry-eyed screen portrait (often made by an American) of rural Ireland as a verdant sanctuary of close traditions, quirky characters, and a more authentic way of life.","Sep 16, 2022"

The Banshees of Inisherin,2022,Martin McDonagh,Los Angeles Times,90,Justin Chang,"One measure of the movie’s skill, and its generosity, is that it embraces the wisdom of both its protagonists. You’ll share Colm’s exasperation and defend his right to pursue an unimpeded life of music and the mind, but you’ll also concede Pádraic’s point that kindness and camaraderie leave behind their own indelible if often invisible legacies.","Oct 20, 2022"
The Banshees of Inisherin,2022,Martin McDonagh,The Globe and Mail (Toronto),90,Kate Taylor,"Both Colm’s initial rejection of Padraic and Padraic’s final crazed reaction are not the stuff of realism or reason but of fairy tales and nightmares, yet Gleeson and Farrell make the film a delight.","Oct 24, 2022"
The Banshees of Inisherin,2022,Martin McDonagh,Vox,90,Alissa Wilkinson,"The break between Colm and Pádraic works on its own terms, but it’s also a startlingly violent fight between men who are basically brothers, a fight that has a logic to it and yet is heartbreaking precisely because of the depth of history between them.

The Banshees of Inisherin,2022,Martin McDonagh,IndieWire,83,David Ehrlich,"This isn’t a film that strives for big laughs — McDonagh seems more interested in putting you in a particular frame of mind, even when doing so requires a fair bit of downtime and dead air — but its constant undercurrent of humor affords the story’s most pressing questions an appropriately ridiculous context, one that speaks to the absurdities of all existence.","Sep 5, 2022"

The Banshees of Inisherin,2022,Martin McDonagh,Consequence,83,Paolo Ragusa,"As an allegory to civil war, it’s well-worked and deeply thoughtful.

Sanctuary,2022,Zachary Wigon,Paste Magazine,70,Brianna Zigler,"Ultimately, Sanctuary’s psychology—which I found a bit muddled at times—is less persuasive than the artistry of shifting, gendered dynamics between Hal and Rebecca, and less enthralling than watching Abbott and Qualley play off of one another.","May 16, 2023"
Sanctuary,2022,Zachary Wigon,Chicago Sun-Times,63,Richard Roeper,"Although Sanctuary is stylish and initially intriguing, it’s eventually a real chore to spend an entire feature-length film (even with a relatively brief running time of 96 minutes) with two boors who are also kind of boring, despite all the histrionics and fang-baring and manipulative mind games.

The Holdovers,2023,Alexander Payne,The Telegraph,100,Robbie Collin,"Giamatti isn’t playing a type, so much as a man who has taken refuge inside one in order to armour himself against the more exposing aspects of human existence.

Shiva Baby,2020,Emma Seligman,Original-Cin,83,Linda Barnard,Seligman’s tight script landed her on Variety’s list of 10 Screenwriters to Watch for 2020.

Even if it’s a bit thematically slight and doesn’t quite stick the landing in congealing what themes it does have into a cohesive whole, sometimes all that’s necessary is an offbeat sense of humor and a weird enough premise to make a lasting impression.","Jun 20, 2022"

Borat Subsequent Moviefilm,2020,Jason Woliner,BBC,80,Nicholas Barber,"Having been made with a specific political purpose, Subsequent MovieFilm won’t age as well as the previous Borat did. Whereas that one will stand as an evergreen comedy, this one might be as ephemeral as a newspaper’s editorial cartoon or an episode of Spitting Image. But it’s the ripped-from-the-headlines relevance that makes it so fascinating, and it’s the boiling rage at current politics that makes it so bracing.

Borat Subsequent Moviefilm,2020,Jason Woliner,Screen Rant,80,Jack Wilhelmi,"Unflinching in its bold lack of subtlety that's contained within a nudge and a wink to the movie's primary audience, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm doesn't hesitate to abruptly kick open the door on polite boundaries, social taboos, and tough talking points that are keeping an entire country at odds.","Oct 22, 2020"
Borat Subsequent Moviefilm,2020,Jason Woliner,Total Film,80,Jordan Farley,"A stupid film made by very smart people, Subsequent Moviefilm has a noble intent at odds with the loathsome figures that populate it. It’s never quite as gut-bustingly funny as the 2006 original, but you get the sense that wasn’t what Cohen was going for. By simply holding a mirror up to the rampant hypocrisy, division and hatred across America and giving bigots the rope to hang themselves, Borat feels more relevant and necessary than ever.","Oct 22, 2020"

Borat Subsequent Moviefilm,2020,Jason Woliner,New York Magazine (Vulture),70,Bilge Ebiri,"Borat 2 may not hit quite as many shocking comic highs as the first Borat, but it probably coheres more as a film — ironic, given that it appears to have been written, produced, and edited in record time, during a global crisis — and it also manages to walk a fine line between offense and revelation.","Oct 22, 2020"
Borat Subsequent Moviefilm,2020,Jason Woliner,ScreenCrush,70,Matt Singer,"Even if Cohen’s targets remain untarnished, even if his attempts to push undecided voters to the ballot box do not succeed, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is still an amusing sequel, with a few moments of surprising sweetness amongst the chaos and horror.","Oct 22, 2020"

Borat Subsequent Moviefilm,2020,Jason Woliner,The Atlantic,65,David Sims,"The movie’s best moments are the fully scripted ones between Borat and Tutar, who have a genuinely sweet bond forged mostly through crude humor.

Borat Subsequent Moviefilm,2020,Jason Woliner,Arizona Republic,60,Bill Goodykoontz,"Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is certainly funny. It’s just not the flash of inspiration the first movie was — it can’t be.

Fallen Leaves,2023,Aki Kaurismäki,IndieWire,83,David Ehrlich,"An 81-minute film that’s as crisp and bittersweet as a late autumn breeze, Kaurismäki’s latest might amount to little more than a bauble in the end, but it offers a stirring reminder — both with its story, and through the experience of watching it — that life can only be so bleak so long as you can still go to the movies and escape it for a little while.","May 25, 2023"
Fallen Leaves,2023,Aki Kaurismäki,The Guardian,80,Peter Bradshaw,"Fallen Leaves is another of Kaurismäki’s beguiling and delightful cinephile comedies, featuring foot-tapping rock’n’roll.

Fallen Leaves,2023,Aki Kaurismäki,The Hollywood Reporter,80,David Rooney,"Running just 81 minutes, Fallen Leaves is slight compared to many of Kaurismäki’s more complex narratives, but its well of feeling creeps up on you and it delivers a good share of laugh-out-loud lines with droll aplomb.

Decision to Leave,2022,Park Chan-wook,The Atlantic,96,Shirley Li,"If the erotic thrillers of the past explored the dangers of lust, Park Chan-wook explores the risks of longing. His take on the genre isn’t just sexy; it’s playful and mordant and convoluted—and it begs to be rewatched, for the electrifying performances and for every frame he composes. It’s the kind of film that, like an overpowering attraction, refuses to be ignored. The only relief comes from indulging it.","Oct 25, 2022"

Decision to Leave,2022,Park Chan-wook,The Playlist,91,Iana Murray,"Decision to Leave is ultimately a seductive romance, one made all the more fascinating by the boundaries the characters tread but never dare cross.

Decision to Leave,2022,Park Chan-wook,Polygon,89,Tasha Robinson,"While the procedural story takes up a fair bit of screen time, the emotional story is the center of the film, and the one that’s likely to stick with audiences longest and most clearly. As a story, it lacks the verve and dynamism of his early action films. As a portrait of obsession and regret, it’s remarkably sophisticated and satisfying.","Oct 17, 2022"
Decision to Leave,2022,Park Chan-wook,Austin Chronicle,89,Josh Kupecki,"The twists and convolutions can seem overwhelming, but Park sustains this high-wire act effortlessly.

M3GAN,2022,Gerard Johnstone,USA Today,75,Brian Truitt,"Produced by horror masters Jason Blum and James Wan (""The Conjuring""), M3GAN satisfies with slasher gusto, “Black Mirror”-esque satire and social media savvy.

M3GAN,2022,Gerard Johnstone,The A.V.

M3GAN,2022,Gerard Johnstone,RogerEbert.com,75,Katie Rife,"The plot does have a few weak points and dangling threads, and the PG-13 rating ensures that the violence is tamped down before it can reach its full bloody potential...But the tongue-in-cheek tone is so consistent that M3gan is a hoot anyway.","Jan 6, 2023"
M3GAN,2022,Gerard Johnstone,Chicago Sun-Times,75,Richard Roeper,"For all its cleverness and pop-culture savvy and meta references, M3GAN also indulges in tropes we’ve seen in a hundred slasher movies, but the dark laughs keep coming, and of course we get an ending that leaves the door open for a potential franchise.

M3GAN,2022,Gerard Johnstone,Uproxx,75,Vince Mancini,"M3GAN is a pretty pitch-perfect satire, of both parenting in the age of predatory technology, and of the tech industry itself. Both of which tend to pit convenience and luxury against mental health and a right to privacy.","Jan 14, 2023"

The horror genre has fallen victim to Big Important Theme–ism of late, and it’s a relief that “Bodies Bodies Bodies” doesn’t descend into a lecture (in fact, it descends into many funny, insincere ones instead).

Civil War,2024,Alex Garland,Slashfilm,85,Jacob Hall,"As a road trip movie, Civil War is quite good, with some segments proving more enthralling than others.

Civil War,2024,Alex Garland,Chicago Tribune,75,Michael Phillips,"I found it coldly gripping, as well as a mite ham-fisted. At its best, this vision of American end times, an election or two from now, sets aside its less persuasive “tell” for more persuasive “show,” without generic spectacle (though with a $50 million production budget, it’s Garland’s and distributor A24’s biggest gamble to date) or diversionary thrills.","Apr 11, 2024"

Civil War,2024,Alex Garland,Rolling Stone,60,David Fear,"The premise is a perfect opportunity to take a cold, hard, genre-inflected look at the American experiment’s current slouching toward self-destruction — the only question is whether Garland’s wild potboiler wants to explore or exploit our state of the nation, and the jury’s still out on that.","Mar 14, 2024"

Pokemon Detective Pikachu,2019,Rob Letterman,Variety,40,Peter Debruge,"Though consistent with the game (with a few extra but obvious twists thrown in for good measure), the story of “Detective Pikachu” doesn’t allow nearly enough Pokémon-related action, while the quality of the computer animation (by Moving Picture Co. and Framestore) falls far short of the basic level of competency audiences have come to expect from effects movies.","May 2, 2019"

Ex Machina,2014,Alex Garland,New York Magazine (Vulture),70,David Edelstein,"Clever novelist and screenwriter Alex Garland makes a half-dandy directorial debut with Ex Machina, a sci-fi film that — like much of his work — fakes excitingly in the direction of breaking new ground before turning formulaic so fast.","Apr 9, 2015"

Airplane!,1980,"Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, Jerry Zucker",The New York Times,90,Janet Maslin,"At a time when throwaway gags seem like a luxury in any film, Airplane! has jokes—hilarious jokes—to spare. It's also clever and confident and furiously energetic, and it has the two most sadly neglected selling points any movie could want right now: it's brief (only eighty-eight minutes), and it looks inexpensive (it cost about three million dollars) without looking cheap. Airplane! is more than a pleasant surprise, in the midst of this dim movie season. As a remedy for the bloated self-importance of too many other current efforts, it's just what the doctor ordered.",

GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,The New York Times,100,Natalia Winkelman,"Beauty is pleasurable, but the film’s use of evocative visuals to focus on storytelling more broadly is what makes it a quiet knockout.","Mar 27, 2025"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,Los Angeles Times,100,Tim Grierson,"The characters’ dilemma may, ultimately, be meaningless set against the ebbs and flows of history, but Gomes, who won the directing prize at last year’s Cannes Film Festival, invests it with such elegance that it becomes nearly mythic: a touching fable of cowardice and devotion with tragic undertones. The scenes may be dreamlike, but they’re our shared dream of being swept away by the movies.","Mar 28, 2025"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,The Film Stage,91,Rory O'Connor,"It all comes together beautifully, a film to stimulate curious corners of the mind and adventurous parts of the spirit.","May 27, 2024"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,Screen Daily,90,Jonathan Romney,"A hypnotic and inventive Asian odyssey ... The viewer may not know exactly where Gomes and his characters are headed, but the journey is pursued with wit, imagination and intelligence, and delivers oblique insights about the way we see the world and history.","May 22, 2024"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,Variety,90,Jessica Kiang,"But for anyone feeling a pessimism creeping in like slow poison and taking the edge off any appetite for adventure, Portuguese singularity Miguel Gomes comes like a comet across the Cannes competition with “Grand Tour,” an enchanting, enlivening, era-spanning, continent-crossing travelogue that runs the very serious risk of infecting you with the antidote: a potent dose of wanderlust-for-life.","May 22, 2024"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,New York Magazine (Vulture),90,Bilge Ebiri,"The film returns us to a childlike gaze, marveling at a world alive with possibility, where every sight lives on a continuum of meaning.","Oct 10, 2024"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,Slant Magazine,88,Brad Hanford,"If Tabu locates the colonial mindset in madness and obsession, Grand Tour does so in cowardice and obliviousness.","Oct 2, 2024"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,The A.V. Club,83,Alex Lei,"Gomes picks apart an imagined past by experiencing its present, at the same time sharply unpacking the screwball comedy by separating the running man and the pursuing woman.","Mar 26, 2025"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,The Guardian,80,Peter Bradshaw,"It is elegant, eccentric and needs some time to be indulged. ... And yes, it is six parts beguiling to one part exasperating. But ... it leaves you with a gentle, bemused smile on your face.","May 22, 2024"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,The Film Verdict,78,Deborah Young,"Gomes is a director poised between ironic narrative and experimentalism pure and simple, and his films (often described as strange, lyrical and hypnotizing) divide audiences into the visionaries and the unconvinced.","May 23, 2024"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,RogerEbert.com,75,Glenn Kenny,"Viewers looking for a tidy narrative and gratifying conclusions will come up short with this movie. But if you can roll with atmospherics that are their own reason for being, “Grand Tour” has plenty, and they’re all beautifully realized.","Mar 28, 2025"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,TheWrap,70,Chase Hutchinson,"It is a wholly uncompromising experience that dances with mirth and melancholy. Proving to be evocative in one moment and unrelentingly exhausting in the next, it’s as gorgeous to behold visually as it is hard to completely embrace thematically. And yet, if you abandon yourself to it by the end as one character says, you can catch glimpses of something spectacularly sublime in the vast journey that it takes on.","May 27, 2024"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,IndieWire,67,David Ehrlich,"But for all the luminous beauty of its images, ""Grand Tour"" sorely lacks a current strong enough to sustain the thoughts that flow between them, compelling as some of those thoughts may be.","May 22, 2024"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,The Hollywood Reporter,60,Jordan Mintzer,"Fans of Gomes’ breakthrough 2012 feature, Tabu, will find much to love here as well, and in terms of craft his latest offers some truly beguiling moments. But anyone looking for a good story, or characters to get hooked on, may find themselves admiring the scenery without ever relishing it.","May 22, 2024"
GRAND TOUR,2024,Miguel Gomes,Collider,60,Aidan Kelley,"The film does show that Gomes is capable of making an authentic period piece and a stunning documentary, but the attempt of trying to do both at the same time has led to an unusual experiment that will leave one scratching their head.","Jan 21, 2025"
WHEN FALL IS COMING,2024,François Ozon,Screen Daily,90,Jonathan Romney,"With a terrific lead from screen and stage veteran Hélène Vincent, this is Ozon in his fine-wine register, but with acerbic notes.","Mar 25, 2025"
WHEN FALL IS COMING,2024,François Ozon,The Hollywood Reporter,80,Leslie Felperin,"Hardcore Ozon fans will have fun arguing about where exactly this falls in the ranking of his substantial body of work, but it’s surely somewhere in the top 10 or even the top five, a rock-solid demonstration of his control over storytelling, technique and ability to get the best from actors.","Oct 8, 2024"
WHEN FALL IS COMING,2024,François Ozon,Variety,80,Guy Lodge,"Nobody is exactly who they appear to be in “When Fall is Coming,” but Ozon’s nimble, perceptive little film takes that as a given: When winter and mortality are beckoning, the past only counts for so much.","Mar 25, 2025"
WHEN FALL IS COMING,2024,François Ozon,The Observer (UK),80,Wendy Ide,"This spry little French-language picture, which delights in subverting our expectations and leaves us with teasing questions about culpability and a crime, shows the director at his most understated, the better to foreground the excellent, intriguingly layered performance from Hélène Vincent.","Mar 25, 2025"
WHEN FALL IS COMING,2024,François Ozon,Slant Magazine,63,Derek Smith,"The film is a bit too muddled to bring its main character fully into focus, despite Hélène Vincent’s best efforts to do so.","Apr 1, 2025"
WHEN FALL IS COMING,2024,François Ozon,The Guardian,60,Peter Bradshaw,"It’s an interesting, strange film, with a key moment withheld from the audience – and yet its omission, and the resulting ambiguity and mystery, is something we are almost supposed to forget about.","Mar 25, 2025"
